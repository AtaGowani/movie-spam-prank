Yes?

3
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,710
What?

4
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:46,543
Sir, kindly switch off your
mobile phone

5
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:48,793
Just one sec, please

6
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:00,710
Excuse me

7
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,251
Excuse me

8
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,543
Sir, please sit down

9
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:34,376
Captain, there's a
medical emergency

10
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:36,303
A passenger has just
fallen down in the aisle

11
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,293
Delhi, Air India 101 returning
due to medical emergency

12
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,293
Excuse me, sir

13
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,751
Hold on!

14
00:03:12,585 --> 00:03:16,460
I'm fine now, thanks.
Carry on, please

15
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:19,293
Wait

16
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,001
- Get the car!
- Mr. Dhillon?

17
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:54,543
Want the name tattooed?
Get the car

18
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,710
To the hotel, sir?

19
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:01,418
Yes, yes, but via Vasant Vihar

20
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,251
Step on the gas, dude!

21
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:19,043
Yeah, Farhan?

22
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,668
Get ready. I'll pick you up
in five minutes

23
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
What happened?

24
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,918
Chatur called. Remember him?

25
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:26,960
The 'Silencer'?

26
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:28,168
Yeah

27
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:31,585
He said Rancho is coming

28
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:34,835
What?

29
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,585
He said - Come to the campus at 8.
On the tank

30
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,210
Oh shucks!

31
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:42,293
Hurry!

32
00:04:42,376 --> 00:04:43,501
Ok

33
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:51,793
Honey, I'll be back soon.
Oh, shoes

34
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:53,876
We found our buddy

35
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:57,668
What?

36
00:04:58,543 --> 00:04:59,876
Tell me later - bye

37
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,210
You forgot your pants

38
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:13,668
Now to the hotel, sir?

39
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:16,835
Yes, but via
Imperial College of Engineering

40
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,460
Ok sir

41
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460
Forgot my socks

42
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,293
More than just your socks

43
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:23,168
Your pants

44
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
Oh no

45
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,001
Now get my brother
from the airport

46
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:41,335
Same last name - Dhillon

47
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:45,085
This is Dhillon.
Where's my cab? On the runway?

48
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:06,626
Hey Rancho

49
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,251
Hey Chatur, where's Rancho?

50
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:10,210
Rancho

51
00:06:11,126 --> 00:06:12,126
Where's Rancho?

52
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,751
Welcome, idiots

53
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:20,460
Some 'madeira' for you?

54
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,210
The same rum you
guzzled those days

55
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,126
Have a drink

56
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:29,001
Where is Rancho?

57
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:32,543
Patience. First look at this

58
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:37,210
Don't eye my wife. Check out
the mansion behind, idiots

59
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,460
$3.5 million

60
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:42,585
Swimming pool - heated!

61
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:45,876
Living room - maple wood flooring

62
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:49,751
My new Lamborghini 6496 cc -

63

very fast

64
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:53,710
Why're you showing us all this?

65
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:55,418
Forgot?

66
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,543
What's this?

67
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,793
'5th September'. Today's date

68
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,418
I challenge you

69
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:23,835
We'll meet again after ten years

70
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:26,210
Same day. Same place

71
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:29,460
We'll see who's more successful

72
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,543
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

73
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,210
Remember? I'd challenged
that idiot right here

74
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,835
I kept my promise. I'm back

75
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,750
Jackass! I aborted a flight,
he forgot his pants

76
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:49,835
all to meet Rancho

77
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:52,876
5 years we've searched.
Don't know if he's alive

78
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:55,668
and you think he'll show up
for your silly bet

79
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:00,001
I know he won't show up

80
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,501
You gonna break his jaw
or should I

81
00:08:04,335 --> 00:08:05,710
So why'd you call us here?

82
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:07,085
To meet Rancho

83
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:11,626
Come and see where I've reached
and where he rots

84
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,168
So you know where Rancho is?

85
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:16,335
Yes

86
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:18,835
Where?

87
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,751
He is in Shimla

88
00:08:27,626 --> 00:08:33,210
<i>Free as the wind was he</i>

89
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:40,043
<i>Like a soaring kite was he</i>

90
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:48,043
<i>Where did he go … let's find him</i>

91
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,251
<i>Free as the wind was he</i>

92
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:11,460
<i>Like a soaring kite was he</i>

93
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:16,960
<i>Where did he go … let's find him</i>

94
00:09:20,043 --> 00:09:23,335
<i>We were led by the path we took</i>

95
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:26,710
<i>While he carved a path of his own</i>

96
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,293
<i>Stumbling, rising, carefree walked he</i>

97
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:37,043
<i>We fretted about the morrow</i>

98
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:40,418
<i>He simply reveled in today</i>

99
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:46,376
<i>Living each moment to the fullest</i>

100
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:50,960
<i>Where did he come from …</i>

101
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:58,293
<i>He who touched our
hearts and vanished …</i>

102
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:04,918
<i>Where did he go … let's find him</i>

103
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:14,793
<i>In scorching Sun,
he was like a patch of shade …</i>

104
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:18,168
<i>In an endless desert, like an oasis …</i>

105
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,168
<i>On a bruised heart,
like soothing balm was he</i>

106
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:28,460
<i>Afraid, we stayed confined in the well</i>

107
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:31,793
<i>Fearless, he frolicked in the river</i>

108
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:37,501
<i>Never hesitating to swim
against the tide</i>

109
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,460
<i>He wandered lonesome as a cloud</i>

110
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:47,626
<i>… Yet he was our dearest friend</i>

111
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:52,793
<i>Where did he go … let's find him</i>

112

115

<i>From birth we were taught -

Don't worry

Oh God,
give me one chance with her

141

Thanks boss. For your tip,

Wear your best underwear tonight

00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,709
Aal izz Well

167
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,710
What did he say?

168
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:44,918
Someone tell him. Hey James Bond

169
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,251
Make him understand

170
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:50,168
Take off your pants or
they are going to piss on you

171
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:52,959
Hey 007! Ashamed to speak Hindi?

172
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,625
Sorry sir, I was born in Uganda,
studied in Pondicherry

173
00:14:56,626 --> 00:14:58,043
so little slow in Hindi

174
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,335
So explain slowly. No hurry

175
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,751
Feeling cold?

176
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:07,543
Pray undress

177
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:12,710
or he'll do
'urine-expulsion' on you

178
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:15,626
Calls pissing 'urine-expulsion'!

179
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:19,501
A true linguist
in the land of engineers!

180
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:26,710
Hey, come out of there

181
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,251
Come out or …

182
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:40,543
or I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door

183
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:52,085
If you aren't out by
the count of ten

184
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:57,418
I'll do 'urine-expulsion'
on your door all semester

185
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,293
One

186
00:16:05,335 --> 00:16:06,668
Two

187
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:14,168
Three

188
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:26,043
Four

189
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,251
Five

190
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:38,793
Six

191
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:46,293
Seven

192
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:53,918
Eight

193
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:00,251
Nine

194
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:10,960
Ten

195
00:17:56,793 --> 00:18:01,293
<i>Salt water is a great conductor
of electricity. 8th Grade Physics</i>

196
00:18:01,918 --> 00:18:04,501
<i>We had studied it. He applied it</i>

197
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:13,751
<i>Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe
was the Director of ICE</i>

198
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:17,251
<i>Students called him Virus,
computer Virus</i>

199
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,210
Virus on the way, with eggs

200
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:24,001
Freshmen are summoned.
Come quickly

201
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,876
<i>Virus was the most competitive
man we had ever seen</i>

202
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:31,251
<i>He couldn't bear anyone
getting ahead of him</i>

203
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:38,251
<i>To save time,
his shirts had Velcro</i>

204
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:39,918
<i>and his ties had hooks</i>

205
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:46,501
<i>He'd trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously</i>

206
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:54,210
<i>Everyday at 2 p.m. he took a
7 ½ minute power nap</i>

207
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:55,876
<i>with an opera as lullaby</i>

208
00:18:59,126 --> 00:19:00,543
<i>Govind, his valet, had instructions</i>

209
00:19:00,793 --> 00:19:06,793
<i>to carry out all unproductive tasks
such as shaving, nail-cutting etc</i>

210
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,500
- What is this?
- Sir, nest

211
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:28,917
- Whose?
- A koel bird's nest, sir

212
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:29,918
Wrong

213
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,793
A koel bird never makes
her own nest

214
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:36,335
She lays her eggs in other nests

215
00:19:38,335 --> 00:19:41,210
And when they hatch,
what do they do?

216
00:19:43,168 --> 00:19:48,793
They push the other eggs
out of the nest

217
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:53,793
Competition over

218
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:58,626
Their life begins with murder.
That's nature

219
00:19:59,793 --> 00:20:02,043
Compete or die

220
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:06,126
You also are like the koel birds

221
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,835
And these are the eggs
you smashed to get into ICE

222
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:20,293
Don't forget, ICE gets
400,000 applications a year

223
00:20:20,543 --> 00:20:24,835
and only 200 are selected - You!

224
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:30,085
And these? Finished. Broken eggs

225
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:34,710
My son … he tried for three years

226
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,126
Rejected. Every time

227
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,085
Remember, life is a race

228
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:47,335
If you don't run fast,
you'll get trampled

229
00:20:48,085 --> 00:20:49,918
Let me tell you a
very interesting story

230
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,460
This is an astronaut pen

231
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:57,376
Fountain pens and ballpoint pens
don't work in outer space

232
00:20:58,251 --> 00:21:02,460
So scientists spent
millions to invent this pen

233
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:07,126
It can write at any angle, in any
temperature, in zero gravity

234
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:09,293
One day, when I was a student

235
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,335
the Director of our institute
called me

236
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:14,043
He said, 'Viru Sahastrabuddhe.'
I said, 'Yes sir'

237
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,626
'Come here!' I got scared

238
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,210
He showed me this pen

239
00:21:19,751 --> 00:21:21,960
He said, 'This is a
symbol of excellence'

240
00:21:23,793 --> 00:21:24,793
'I give it to you'

241
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:30,543
'When you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself

242
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:32,835
… pass it onto him'

243
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,251
For 32 years, I've been
waiting for that student

244
00:21:38,668 --> 00:21:39,793
But no luck

245
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:44,626
Anyone here, who'll strive
to win this pen?

246
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:49,335
Good. Put your hands down

247
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:56,418
Shall I post it on the notice board?
Hands down

248
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,210
One question, sir

249
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:03,168
Sir, if pens didn't work
in outer space

250
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,335
why didn't the astronauts
use a pencil?

251
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,251
They'd have saved millions

252
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:23,710
I will get back to you on this

253
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:30,001
He zaps a Senior's privates
at night

254
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,460
fingers the Director in the day.
Best avoid him

255
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,710
You deflated Virus's erection

256
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,751
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

257
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,335
Buzz off. You don't have school?

258
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,375
Who'll pay for it? Your pop?

259
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:47,668
- Keep off my dad!
- Relax

260
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,668
For school you don't need
tuition money, just a uniform

261
00:22:51,918 --> 00:22:57,293
Pick a school,
buy the uniform, slip into class

262
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,585
In that sea of kids,
no one will notice

263
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:03,001
If I get caught?
Then new uniform, new school

264
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,376
See that? <i>- He was different …</i>

265
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:09,043
<i>He challenged conventions
at every stage</i>

266
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,376
<i>A free-spirited bird had
landed in Virus's nest</i>

267
00:23:13,335 --> 00:23:16,168
<i>We were robots, blindly following
our professors' commands</i>

268
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:19,418
<i>He was the only one
who was not a machine</i>

269
00:23:19,626 --> 00:23:22,043
What is a machine?

270
00:23:27,418 --> 00:23:29,001
Why're you smiling?

271
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,210
Sir, to study Engineering
was a childhood dream

272
00:23:34,085 --> 00:23:36,501
I'm so happy to be here finally

273
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:40,918
No need to be so happy.
Define a machine

274
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:45,751
A machine is anything that
reduces human effort

275
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,543
Will you please elaborate?

276
00:23:51,168 --> 00:23:56,335
Anything that simplifies work,
or saves time, is a machine

277
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:00,625
It's a warm day, press a button,
get a blast of air

278
00:24:00,626 --> 00:24:01,960
The fan … A machine!

279
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:05,751
Speak to a friend miles away.
The telephone … A machine!

280
00:24:06,126 --> 00:24:09,001
Compute millions in seconds.
The calculator … A machine!

281
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:11,710
We're surrounded by machines

282
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:14,751
From a pen's nib to a pants' zip -
all machines

283
00:24:15,126 --> 00:24:17,585
Up and down in a second.
Up, down, up, down …

284
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:21,876
What is the definition?

285
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:24,293
I just gave it to you, sir

286
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:29,501
You'll write this in the exam?
This is a machine - up, down …

287
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:32,293
Idiot! Anybody else?

288
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,043
Yes?

289
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:36,667
Sir, machines are any combination
of bodies so connected

290
00:24:36,668 --> 00:24:38,348
that their relative motions
are constrained

291
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,751
and by which means, force
and motion may be transmitted

292
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:43,168
and modified as a screw
and its nut, or a lever arranged

293
00:24:43,335 --> 00:24:45,960
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot, etc

294
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:48,292
especially, a construction,
more or less complex

295
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:50,292
consisting of a combination
of moving parts, or

296
00:24:50,293 --> 00:24:53,585
simple mechanical elements,
as wheels, levers, cams etc

297
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Wonderful

298
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,626
Perfect. Please sit down

299
00:24:57,918 --> 00:24:59,210
Thank you

300
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:03,626
But sir, I said the same thing,
in simple language

301
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:07,793
If you prefer simple language,
join an Arts and Commerce college

302
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,793
But sir, one must get
the meaning too

303
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:13,418
What's the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition

304
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,293
You think you're smarter
than the book?

305
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:20,626
Write the textbook definition, mister,
if you want to pass

306
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:22,543
But there are other books …
Get out!

307
00:25:23,585 --> 00:25:24,835
Why?

308
00:25:25,043 --> 00:25:27,043
In simple language - Out!

309
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:37,918
Idiot!

310
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:42,376
So, we were discussing
the machine …

311
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,001
Why're you back?

312
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:47,126
I forgot something

313
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:48,793
What?

314
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:52,209
Instruments that record,
analyze, summarize, organize

315
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,644
debate and explain information;
That are illustrated, non-illustrated

316
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:56,543
hard-bound, paperback,
jacketed, non jacketed

317
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:58,792
with foreword, introduction,
table-of-contents, index

318
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,769
that are intended for the
enlightenment, understanding

319
00:26:00,793 --> 00:26:02,561
enrichment, enhancement and
education of the human brain

320
00:26:02,585 --> 00:26:04,668
through the sensory route of
vision, sometimes touch

321
00:26:10,543 --> 00:26:12,460
What do you mean?

322
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:14,001
Books, sir

323
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:17,001
I forgot my books. May I?

324
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,001
Couldn't you ask simply?

325
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,626
I tried earlier, sir.
It simply didn't work

326
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,751
<i>Professors kept Rancho
mostly out … seldom in</i>

327
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,001
<i>When thrown out of one class,
he'd slip into another</i>

328
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:39,460
<i>He said - First year or fourth year,
it's knowledge. Just grab it</i>

329
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,251
<i>He was unlike any of us</i>

330
00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:43,876
<i>We fought for a shower
every morning</i>

331
00:26:44,501 --> 00:26:46,710
<i>He'd bathe wherever
he found water</i>

332
00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:47,918
Morning, sir

333
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:51,460
<i>Machines were his passion</i>

334
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:56,001
<i>When he spotted them,
he opened them</i>

335
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:57,456
<i>Some he could re-assemble …</i>

336
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,751
<i>some he couldn't</i>

337
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:03,126
<i>There was another, just like him</i>

338
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,168
<i>Joy Lobo</i>

339
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,626
Sir. Excuse me, sir

340
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:11,710
Mr. Joy Lobo!

341
00:27:12,668 --> 00:27:15,043
Sir, if I could know the
convocation dates …

342
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,126
Why?

343
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:17,918
Dad wants to make
train reservations

344
00:27:18,335 --> 00:27:21,793
I'm the first engineer from my
village. Everyone wants to attend

345
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,876
In that case, call your dad

346
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:27,460
Please hurry up.
Don't waste my time

347
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:34,918
Hello

348
00:27:35,085 --> 00:27:38,085
Dad, the Director wants to
speak to you

349
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:39,293
Joy!

350
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:41,876
Mr. Lobo, your son won't
graduate this year

351
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,500
What happened, sir?

352
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:46,626
He has violated all deadlines

353
00:27:46,876 --> 00:27:50,710
Mr. Lobo, it's an unrealistic project

354
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,751
He is making some
nonsense helicopter

355
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:57,668
I suggest you don't book
your tickets. I'm so sorry

356
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:02,293
Sir, I am this close, sir
Is your project ready?

357
00:28:02,876 --> 00:28:06,668
Is your project ready?
Sir, see it once, please

358
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:08,418
Submit it, and we'll consider

359
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:11,042
Sir, a small extension …
Why, why should I?

360
00:28:11,043 --> 00:28:14,126
After dad's stroke,
I couldn't focus for two months

361
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,501
Did you stop eating?

362
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,043
No

363
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:18,293
Stopped bathing?

364
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:20,210
So why stop studying?

365
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:23,043
Sir, I'm very close.
See it once, please …

366
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,335
Mr. Lobo!

367
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,543
Sunday afternoon, my son
fell off a train and died

368
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:32,793
Monday morning, I taught a class.
So don't give me that nonsense

369
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:37,960
I can give you sympathy,
not an extension

370
00:28:39,043 --> 00:28:40,626
Sir … I'm very close …

371
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:12,710
<i>Lifelong I lived</i>

381
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:54,668

383
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:03,275
Dude's come up with an
amazing design

384
00:30:03,626 --> 00:30:05,043
A wireless camera atop a helicopter

385
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:09,543
Can be used for
traffic updates, security … Wow!

386
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,835
But Virus said it's an
impractical design, it won't fly

387
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:15,126
It will fly! We'll make it fly

388
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,626
Don't tell Joy. It'll be a surprise

389
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:22,668
We'll fly it up to his window
and capture his reaction

390
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:25,376
If we work on his project,
who'll work on ours?

391
00:30:25,918 --> 00:30:28,960
Tests, vivas, quizzes -
42 exams per semester

392
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:30,793
You scare easily, bro

393
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:36,418
Take your hand, put it over your
heart, and say, 'Aal izz well'

394
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,793
- All is well?
- Aal izz well

395
00:30:39,126 --> 00:30:41,460
Words of wisdom from
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

396
00:30:42,001 --> 00:30:44,085
We had an old watchman
in our village

397
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:50,168
On night patrol, he'd call out,
'Aal izz well'

398
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:54,293
And we slept peacefully.
Then there was a theft

399
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:56,543
and we learned that
he couldn't see at night!

400
00:30:56,876 --> 00:31:00,293
He'd just yell 'Aal izz well',
and we felt secure

401
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,751
That day I understood
this heart scares easily

402
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:09,585
You have to trick it

403
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:16,543
However big the problem,
tell your heart, 'All is well, pal'

404
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,501
That resolves the problem?

405
00:31:19,793 --> 00:31:21,543
No. But you gain courage to face it

406
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:27,418
Learn it up, bro.
We're gonna really need it here

407
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:49,543

Take it higher

455
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:16,251
Look at Silencer - the nude dude!

456
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,251
Joy, come out

457
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:24,835
Come to the window

458
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:26,418
Joy, look outside

459
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:21,793
Good news, sir

460
00:36:23,043 --> 00:36:26,001
The police and Joy's father
have no clue

461
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:28,626
Everyone thinks this is suicide

462
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:32,043
The post mortem report -

463
00:36:32,376 --> 00:36:34,668
Cause of Death: Intense
pressure on windpipe

464
00:36:34,918 --> 00:36:35,918
resulting in choking

465
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:42,585
All think the pressure
on the jugular killed him

466
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:47,251
What about the mental pressure
for the last four years?

467
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:49,371
That's missing in the report

468
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,751
Engineers are a clever bunch

469
00:36:55,251 --> 00:36:58,543
They haven't made a machine
to measure mental pressure

470
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:02,335
If they had, all would know …

471
00:37:03,585 --> 00:37:04,960
this isn't suicide … it's murder

472
00:37:09,335 --> 00:37:13,085
How dare you blame me
for Joy's suicide?

473
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:16,793
If one student can't handle
pressure, is it our fault?

474
00:37:17,293 --> 00:37:20,876
Life is full of pressures.
Will you always blame others?

475
00:37:21,335 --> 00:37:25,126
I don't blame you, sir.
I blame the system

476
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:30,751
Look at these statistics -
India ranks No. 1 in suicides

477
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:34,835
Every 90 minutes,
a student attempts suicide

478
00:37:36,543 --> 00:37:39,418
Suicide is a bigger killer
than disease

479
00:37:39,668 --> 00:37:40,960
Something's terribly wrong, sir

480
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:43,335
I can't speak for the rest

481
00:37:44,043 --> 00:37:46,123
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country

482
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:48,626
I've run this place for 32 years

483
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:52,418
We were ranked 28th.
Now we're No. 1

484
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:54,168
What's the point, sir?

485
00:37:55,793 --> 00:37:59,168
Here they don't discuss
new ideas or inventions

486
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:05,876
They discuss grades,
jobs, settling in the USA

487
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:12,085
They teach how to get good scores.
They don't teach Engineering

488
00:38:12,293 --> 00:38:14,460
Now you will teach me
how to teach?

489
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
No sir, I …

490
00:38:19,126 --> 00:38:20,168
Sir, my paper …

491
00:38:39,085 --> 00:38:40,245
Vaidyanathan, please sit down

492
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,835
Here is a
self-proclaimed professor

493
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:49,001
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers

494
00:38:49,751 --> 00:38:54,168
Professor Ranchhoddas Chanchad
will teach us Engineering

495
00:39:12,126 --> 00:39:14,418
We do not have all day

496
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:55,626
You have 30 seconds
to define these terms

497
00:39:56,085 --> 00:39:58,085
You may refer to your books

498
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,710
Raise your hand
if you get the answer

499
00:40:02,043 --> 00:40:05,376
Let's see who comes first,
who comes last

500
00:40:06,251 --> 00:40:09,460
Your time starts … now

501
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:40,126
Time up

502
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:43,585
Time up, sir

503
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,793
No one got the answer?

504
00:40:50,335 --> 00:40:53,668
Now rewind your life by a minute

505
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:57,710
When I asked this question,
were you excited? Curious?

506
00:40:57,918 --> 00:41:00,626
Thrilled that you'd learn
something new?

507
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,835
Anyone?… Sir?

508
00:41:06,793 --> 00:41:09,585
No. You all got into a frantic race

509
00:41:11,668 --> 00:41:13,788
What's the use of such methods,
even if you come first

510
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:19,376
Will your knowledge increase?
No, just the pressure

511
00:41:20,335 --> 00:41:21,895
This is a college,
not a pressure cooker

512
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:27,585
Even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip

513
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:32,292
But you call such a lion
'well trained', not 'well educated'

514
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:33,293
Hello!

515
00:41:33,751 --> 00:41:38,293
This is not a philosophy class.
Just explain those two words

516
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,376
Sir, these words don't exist

517
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,876
These are my friends' names.
Farhan and Raju

518
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,460
Quiet!

519
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:02,668
Nonsense! Is this how
you'll teach Engineering?

520
00:42:03,168 --> 00:42:05,043
Sir, I wasn't teaching
you Engineering

521
00:42:05,668 --> 00:42:07,126
You're an expert at that

522
00:42:08,001 --> 00:42:11,210
I was teaching you … how to teach

523
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:15,960
And I'm sure one day you'll learn

524
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,960
because unlike you, I never
abandon my weak students

525
00:42:20,501 --> 00:42:21,501
Bye, sir

526
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:24,626
Quiet!

527
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,293
Quiet, I said

528
00:42:31,793 --> 00:42:35,126
<i>I regret to inform you
that your son …</i>

529
00:42:35,293 --> 00:42:36,376
<i>Farhan … Raju …</i>

530
00:42:36,668 --> 00:42:37,748
<i>has fallen into bad company</i>

531
00:42:38,085 --> 00:42:41,210
<i>Without urgent corrective steps,
his future will be ruined</i>

532
00:42:42,335 --> 00:42:45,585
<i>Virus's letters dropped on
our homes like atom bombs</i>

533
00:42:45,918 --> 00:42:48,459
<i>Hiroshima and Nagasaki
plunged into gloom</i>

534
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,501
<i>Our parents invited us -
for a dressing down</i>

535
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:54,710
Come in

536
00:42:57,293 --> 00:42:58,293
See that?

537
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:02,168
We could afford
just one air-conditioner

538
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,585
We put it in Farhan's room,
so he could study in comfort

539
00:43:09,085 --> 00:43:13,001
I didn't buy a car.
I manage with a scooter

540
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:15,751
We put all our money
into Farhan's education

541
00:43:17,293 --> 00:43:21,376
We sacrificed our comforts
for Farhan's future. Understand?

542
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:31,376
You took these pictures, Farhan?

543
00:43:33,335 --> 00:43:35,293
He had that useless
obsession for a while

544
00:43:36,293 --> 00:43:38,042
Went around taking
pictures of animals

545
00:43:38,043 --> 00:43:40,793
Wanted to be a
wildlife photographer

546
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:44,418
Son, what was your
score that year?

547
00:43:45,418 --> 00:43:46,585
91%

548
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,585
Hear that? Straight drop
from 94% to 91%

549
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,168
You find it funny?

550
00:43:56,876 --> 00:44:00,918
No sir, sorry. I'm just
amazed at the photos

551
00:44:01,126 --> 00:44:03,710
Why make him an engineer …
Why not a wildlife photographer?

552
00:44:03,918 --> 00:44:05,043
Enough!

553
00:44:06,335 --> 00:44:11,585
I humbly request you -
Don't ruin my son's future

554
00:44:13,126 --> 00:44:15,460
Food's on the table, boys. C'mon

555
00:44:20,418 --> 00:44:22,668
If you ever visit again,
do eat with us

556
00:44:25,626 --> 00:44:27,043
<i>Dad denied us a meal …</i>

557
00:44:27,668 --> 00:44:29,293
<i>So, to fill our bellies with food …</i>

558
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,960
<i>and ears with more reprimands,
we reached Raju's house</i>

559
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,001
<i>Raju's house was straight
out of a 50's black and white film</i>

560
00:44:39,793 --> 00:44:40,793
<i>A small, dingy room …</i>

561
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,418
<i>a paralyzed father …</i>

562
00:44:43,251 --> 00:44:44,418
<i>a coughing mother …</i>

563
00:44:44,835 --> 00:44:46,293
<i>and an unwed sister</i>

564
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,793
<i>A sofa sprouting springs …</i>

565
00:44:49,293 --> 00:44:51,543
<i>a 24 hour water supply -
from the leaking roof</i>

566
00:44:52,251 --> 00:44:55,835
<i>Mother was a retired school
teacher and a tireless complainer</i>

567
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:58,668
<i>Father was once a postmaster</i>

568
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,585
<i>Paralysis shut down
his body partly …</i>

569
00:45:02,085 --> 00:45:04,460
<i>his salary completely.
And the sister …</i>

570
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:08,251
Kammo's turned 28.
They demand a car in dowry

571
00:45:08,918 --> 00:45:11,501
If you don't study and earn,
how will she marry?

572
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,043
Some okra?

573
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,793
Okra is now 12/- per kilo,
cauliflower is 10/-

574
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:19,543
It's daylight robbery!

575
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,918
What will we eat if we get
warnings from your college?

576
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,210
Mom!

577
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:27,710
Cottage cheese?

578
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:31,626
Cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers, in velvet pouches

579
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,710
Cottage cheese? No, no, it's ok

580
00:45:34,418 --> 00:45:35,918
Mom, please

581
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:38,585
Alright, I'll shut up

582
00:45:40,293 --> 00:45:44,751
Earn for the family,
slave like a maid

583
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:47,251
and then take the vow of silence

584
00:45:48,251 --> 00:45:52,751
If not with my son, with whom
do I share my woes - his friends?

585
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:57,751
Hey Raju

586
00:46:01,335 --> 00:46:02,335
<i>We were in a huge dilemma</i>

587
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:06,085
<i>Do we comfort our friend
or console his mom?</i>

588
00:46:07,335 --> 00:46:10,251
<i>Screw it, we thought, let's
focus on the cottage cheese</i>

589
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:25,001
Even his eczema cream
costs 55/- now

590
00:46:29,793 --> 00:46:31,085
Another roti?

591
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,376
No, thank you. We're through

592
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,751
Okra for 12/-
Cauliflower for 10/

593
00:46:47,835 --> 00:46:49,626
At least you were offered a meal

594
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:53,335
Unlike your sadistic dad …
'Hitler' Qureshi!

595
00:46:53,501 --> 00:46:56,168
And your mom is Mother Teresa …
Feeding us 'eczema roti'!

596
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,001
Don't poke fun at my mom!
Enough, you guys

597
00:47:00,335 --> 00:47:01,710
I'm famished. Let's eat out

598
00:47:01,876 --> 00:47:04,210
It's month end. Who'll pay?
His Mother Teresa?

599
00:47:05,293 --> 00:47:09,835
To eat out, you don't need money.
Just a uniform. Look …

600
00:47:12,668 --> 00:47:14,293
C'mon - Come

601
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:18,250
Good evening, good evening

602
00:47:18,251 --> 00:47:19,251
Oh, Uncle

603
00:47:24,418 --> 00:47:27,626
Three large vodkas.
Half soda, half water

604
00:47:27,876 --> 00:47:29,085
If we're caught, we're dead

605
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:31,917
What's for starters?
Get double portions

606
00:47:31,918 --> 00:47:34,918
Leave this here and start
some peppy music

607
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,335
Pia, what the hell!

608
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:40,418
Why're you wearing
this ancient piece of junk?

609
00:47:41,668 --> 00:47:45,210
What'll people say - My fiancée …

610
00:47:45,668 --> 00:47:48,210
a doctor in the making,
wearing a cheap, 200/- watch!

611
00:47:49,168 --> 00:47:50,626
Please take it off. Thank you

612
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,210
Hi handsome

613
00:47:52,376 --> 00:47:55,292
Hey Aunty. You're looking good

614
00:47:55,293 --> 00:47:57,835
Don't miss my set, darling
Rubies?

615
00:47:58,043 --> 00:48:00,750
From Mandalay - Mandalay … Wow!

616
00:48:00,751 --> 00:48:03,418
Hey, let's go meet David
Of course

617
00:48:06,793 --> 00:48:07,793
Excuse me

618
00:48:09,876 --> 00:48:11,001
Yes?

619
00:48:11,335 --> 00:48:12,376
Flowers

620
00:48:13,918 --> 00:48:17,085
- May I take the glass?
- Why?

621
00:48:17,418 --> 00:48:19,668
So you don't break it on my head

622
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:21,710
Why would I do that?

623
00:48:22,168 --> 00:48:24,251
For the free advice I'll now impart

624
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,460
What?

625
00:48:26,668 --> 00:48:28,210
Don't marry that ass

626
00:48:29,335 --> 00:48:30,335
Excuse me?

627
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,126
He's not a human,
he's a price tag

628
00:48:32,585 --> 00:48:35,543
He'll turn your life into a
nightmare of brands and prices

629
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:38,751
He'll ruin your life.
Your future will be finished

630
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:40,085
Want a demonstration?

631
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:43,710
Shall I find out
the price of his shoes?

632
00:48:45,293 --> 00:48:47,168
I won't ask.
He'll announce it himself

633
00:48:59,251 --> 00:49:05,168
What the hell …
Mint sauce on my $300 shoes!

634
00:49:05,335 --> 00:49:08,501
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

635
00:49:09,085 --> 00:49:11,751
Genuine Italian leather -
hand-stitched!

636
00:49:16,376 --> 00:49:19,043
Dad, are they your guests?

637
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:25,668
My students.
What're they doing here?

638
00:49:29,668 --> 00:49:30,835
Hold on, Dad

639
00:49:32,418 --> 00:49:34,626
These beans smell great

640
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:37,085
No room for roti Just pile it on

641
00:49:39,085 --> 00:49:40,418
Hi - Hey

642
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:44,960
That was an eye-opener.
Thank you so much

643
00:49:46,501 --> 00:49:48,751
It was my moral responsibility

644
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:50,985
Can I ask you for little more help?

645
00:49:52,085 --> 00:49:54,668
Dad won't let me break off
this engagement

646
00:49:55,668 --> 00:49:59,626
You explain so well.
Can you give him a demo too?

647
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,543
Certainly. Raju, the mint sauce

648
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:04,543
You're really sweet

649
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:08,835
Where is your daddy?
Right behind you

650
00:50:13,501 --> 00:50:15,793
Aal izz well

651
00:50:16,626 --> 00:50:21,751
Run for your life!
It's free advice. Take it or leave it

652
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:23,585
What're you doing here?

653
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:27,335
We'll hand these gifts
to the couple

654
00:50:28,418 --> 00:50:30,668
I'll do that for you.
It's my sister's wedding

655
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:32,251
Sister?

656
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:37,501
Sir, what's the sum total
of your daughters?

657
00:50:39,126 --> 00:50:40,126
Empty. No gift cheques

658
00:50:40,335 --> 00:50:42,500
Forgot the cheques, Raju
… Farhan?

659
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:46,626
We didn't invite you,
you must be from the groom's side

660
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:51,085
No sir, we're here as the
emissaries of science

661
00:50:51,251 --> 00:50:53,418
How? Can you explain?

662
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:57,335
Dad, he explains superbly.
I'm sure he'll give us a demo

663
00:50:57,668 --> 00:50:58,668
Won't you?

664
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:03,001
Well, Delhi has plenty of
power cuts that …

665
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,585
disrupt wedding celebrations

666
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,043
So I thought of making
an inverter that …

667
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,585
draws power from guests' cars

668
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:12,168
I see

669
00:51:12,418 --> 00:51:13,876
Wow

670
00:51:14,293 --> 00:51:15,668
So where's the inverter?

671
00:51:16,501 --> 00:51:18,085
Sir, the design is ready

672
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,460
Where's the design, Farhan?

673
00:51:22,918 --> 00:51:25,918
I gave you the design
I gave it to Raju

674
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:27,376
Raju, design?

675
00:51:30,418 --> 00:51:34,126
Never mind the design.
I'll make the inverter and show you

676
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:38,126
You can only invent stories,
not an inverter

677
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,501
I'll make one, I promise

678
00:51:41,876 --> 00:51:45,335
And I'll name it after you.
After all, it was invented …

679
00:51:45,793 --> 00:51:49,251
at your daughter's wedding.
So it'll be an honor …

680
00:51:49,418 --> 00:51:55,418
Farhan, Raju. I'll see you
in my office tomorrow

681
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:04,793
Sir, what was the cost per plate?
We'll reimburse you

682
00:52:05,168 --> 00:52:06,793
… in installments

683
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:12,501
We'll never crash a wedding again
Not even my own

684
00:52:12,668 --> 00:52:14,876
In fact, I won't even marry.
Nor will he

685
00:52:15,585 --> 00:52:17,585
Uh … right. No marriage

686
00:52:19,126 --> 00:52:21,460
Your parents shouldn't have
married either

687
00:52:23,168 --> 00:52:25,668
The world would have
to feed two less idiots

688
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:29,210
Sit!

689
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:41,251
Pay attention

690
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:57,126
This is Ranchhoddas's father's
monthly income

691
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:04,793
Couple of zeroes less,
and it's still a sizeable income

692
00:53:07,376 --> 00:53:13,668
But erase another zero,
and I would worry a little

693
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,293
Isn't that your fathers income,
Farhan?

694
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:20,876
Yes, sir

695
00:53:22,293 --> 00:53:24,293
Now take away another zero …

696
00:53:27,376 --> 00:53:31,126
and that's your family income,
Raju Rastogi

697
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:33,668
Big reason to worry

698
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:45,543
Take my advice and shift into
Chatur Ramalingam's room

699
00:53:46,001 --> 00:53:50,210
Exams are here. Stay with
Rancho and you're sure to fail

700
00:54:12,168 --> 00:54:14,543
- Want a shave?
- No, sir

701
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,751
Then get lost!

702
00:54:26,876 --> 00:54:32,418
Raju, don't worry. This is Virus's
move to split us. Divide and rule

703
00:54:32,585 --> 00:54:33,626
I have to worry

704
00:54:34,085 --> 00:54:37,543
He grades us, and I need
good grades for a good job

705
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:41,501
Unlike you, I don't have a
rich dad I can live off

706
00:54:41,668 --> 00:54:43,501
Shut up, Raju

707
00:54:43,793 --> 00:54:46,418
Must we follow all his hogwash?
'Aal izz well'

708
00:54:46,835 --> 00:54:48,251
I won't be his flunky … like you

709
00:54:49,251 --> 00:54:51,501
You're crossing the line
No, I'm drawing one

710
00:54:52,043 --> 00:54:53,710
I have a family to support

711
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,168
Dad's medicines
swallow up mom's pension

712
00:55:00,168 --> 00:55:04,501
My sis can't marry because
they want a car in dowry

713
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:11,668
Mom hasn't bought a
single saree in five years

714
00:55:14,543 --> 00:55:17,710
Now don't get your mom's
wardrobe into the debate

715
00:55:18,876 --> 00:55:20,916
By the way, how many sarees
per annum is reasonable?

716
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,168
Hey … no wisecracks about mom

717
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,168
We'll study with all our heart,
but not just for grades

718
00:55:28,876 --> 00:55:33,168
To quote a Wise One - Study
to be accomplished, not affluent

719
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:39,460
Follow excellence. And success
will chase you, pants down!

720
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,293
Which Wise One says this?
His Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas?

721
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:46,376
Go rot in the bogs!

722
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:50,960
Raju, don't stress. We'll top
our class. Nothing is impossible

723
00:55:51,293 --> 00:55:52,418
Oh yeah?

724
00:55:56,126 --> 00:55:58,210
Shove this back into the tube

725
00:56:01,293 --> 00:56:02,876
<i>Raju got onto another train</i>

726
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:08,585
<i>His travails with Chatur began.
Yes, I mean travails, not travels</i>

727
00:56:13,043 --> 00:56:14,918
<i>Chatur was called 'Silencer'</i>

728
00:56:15,293 --> 00:56:18,960
<i>To sharpen his memory,
he popped pills from a local quack</i>

729
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:21,335
<i>And then let off silent …
but lethal farts</i>

730
00:56:24,085 --> 00:56:27,251
I didn't do it … Raju?

731
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,085
<i>He always blamed others
for the output</i>

732
00:56:30,876 --> 00:56:33,710
<i>Silencer crammed 18 hours a day</i>

733
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:37,085
<i>On exam eve,
he would distract others</i>

734
00:56:41,085 --> 00:56:44,126
<i>His belief - There are only
two ways of topping</i>

735
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,751
<i>Elevate your own grades or
shrink your opponents' grades</i>

736
00:56:52,085 --> 00:56:55,918
<i>Rancho decided to subdue
Silencer and rescue Raju …</i>

737
00:56:56,418 --> 00:56:57,668
<i>with one master plan</i>

738
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:07,751
Our Director has unceasingly
served … 'Served' means …

739
00:57:07,835 --> 00:57:11,835
Damn the meaning,
I'll memorize it

740
00:57:13,293 --> 00:57:16,876
<i>Chatur was the introductory speaker
at the Teachers' Day function</i>

741
00:57:17,251 --> 00:57:21,126
<i>To impress Virus, he got his
speech written by the librarian …</i>

742
00:57:21,376 --> 00:57:22,668
<i>in highbrow Hindi</i>

743
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:29,585
Hello. Hold on.
Chatur, call for you

744
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:32,376
Please collect the printout.
I'll be right back

745
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:37,043
Oh … the things I have to do …

746
00:57:40,668 --> 00:57:43,793
Mr. Dubey, the Director was
remembering you

747
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,501
- Really?
- Yes. Just now

748
00:57:45,918 --> 00:57:49,251
I'll see him right away.
Give this to Chatur

749
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:57,460
Hello. Hello
Hello, Mr. Ramalingam?

750
00:57:57,626 --> 00:57:58,626
Yes?

751
00:57:59,126 --> 00:58:01,460
I'm calling from the police station

752
00:58:01,876 --> 00:58:04,668
- Are you from Uganda?
- Yes sir

753
00:58:06,251 --> 00:58:09,251
Your life is in danger
What?… How?

754
00:58:10,418 --> 00:58:12,168
Listen carefully, or else …

755
00:58:12,835 --> 00:58:17,126
you'll get killed as you step out
of the college gate

756
00:58:17,918 --> 00:58:19,126
Why? What happened?

757
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:20,835
<i>While Chatur was kept engaged</i>

758
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:25,251
<i>Rancho altered a few words
in his speech, for example …</i>

759
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:27,835
<i>'served' became 'screwed'</i>

760
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:29,960
Yes sir?

761
00:58:30,543 --> 00:58:33,043
- Who are you?
- Dubey. Librarian

762
00:58:35,668 --> 00:58:36,793
I'm permanent staff, sir

763
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,835
Congratulations

764
00:58:39,293 --> 00:58:42,626
Hold on a moment.
The chief is on the other line

765
00:58:43,043 --> 00:58:44,043
Excuse me, sir

766
00:58:53,668 --> 00:58:55,876
Yes … so where was I?

767
00:58:56,168 --> 00:58:58,543
You said I may die …
outside the gate

768
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:05,085
Right. As you get out of the gate,
you'll see a traffic signal

769
00:59:05,335 --> 00:59:07,335
Traffic signal. Ok

770
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:13,085
When it turns red,
all the cars will halt

771
00:59:13,626 --> 00:59:14,918
Ok. Then?

772
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:17,043
Then cross the road
with great caution

773
00:59:17,835 --> 00:59:23,043
Because son, in rush hour
if a car hits you, you're dead

774
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:26,793
What nonsense! I know that

775
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,501
You know that? Excellent.
Then you're safe my boy

776
00:59:37,585 --> 00:59:39,626
From the librarian, Silencer

777
00:59:39,793 --> 00:59:41,335
You don't call me that, Chanchad

778
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,251
Hey. The Director said
he didn't call for me

779
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:52,293
Who said 'called'?
I just said he 'remembered' you

780
00:59:52,501 --> 00:59:55,043
Remembered? Rascals!

781
01:00:03,126 --> 01:00:05,251
Distinguished Mr. Chairperson

782
01:00:07,585 --> 01:00:11,835
Chief guest, the Honorable
Minister of Education

783
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:16,418
respected teachers and friends

784
01:00:18,043 --> 01:00:22,876
ICE has now soared
beyond the stratosphere

785
01:00:23,543 --> 01:00:27,793
The credit goes solely to

786
01:00:28,251 --> 01:00:32,001
Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe.
Give him a big hand

787
01:00:32,168 --> 01:00:36,168
Sir, the voice is his
but the words are mine

788
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,168
He's a great guy, really you are

789
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:48,835
For 32 years, he has
unceasingly screwed students

790
01:00:51,418 --> 01:00:53,751
He means - 'served' students

791
01:00:54,043 --> 01:00:56,585
I'm sure his endeavors
will continue

792
01:00:59,293 --> 01:01:04,293
We are astounded at
how one man, in one lifetime

793
01:01:04,543 --> 01:01:07,418
can screw so many, so well

794
01:01:10,543 --> 01:01:15,793
With rigorous training
he's built up his stamina

795
01:01:19,543 --> 01:01:26,126
He's spent every living minute
just screwing

796
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:30,460
Let's replicate his methods

797
01:01:34,293 --> 01:01:39,918
Tomorrow ICE students
will go across the globe

798
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:46,793
Wherever we go,
we promise to screw

799
01:01:50,876 --> 01:01:54,043
We'll hoist this screwer's flag
all over the world

800
01:01:59,668 --> 01:02:04,418
We'll show the world that
our capacity to screw …

801
01:02:04,793 --> 01:02:06,751
cannot be matched by any student …

802
01:02:07,043 --> 01:02:10,543
anywhere on the planet

803
01:02:18,293 --> 01:02:21,293
Mr. Minister. Good evening

804
01:02:21,918 --> 01:02:29,376
You have given this institution
what it sorely needs

805
01:02:30,168 --> 01:02:31,751
Booty, funds - Bosom

806
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,501
It's booty, stupid. Bosom means …

807
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,960
What nonsense! That's insulting

808
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:46,126
Everyone has a bosom,
but it remains pocketed

809
01:02:47,751 --> 01:02:49,710
No one offers it so readily

810
01:02:53,751 --> 01:02:54,751
Vulgar fellow!

811
01:02:54,876 --> 01:02:56,460
You have generously offered
your bosom …

812
01:02:56,876 --> 01:02:59,918
to this relentless screwer

813
01:03:02,918 --> 01:03:07,126
Now see how he makes it grow

814
01:03:07,418 --> 01:03:11,626
Is this what you teach here, Director?

815
01:03:19,335 --> 01:03:22,710
On this august occasion,
here's a Sanskrit verse …

816
01:03:22,876 --> 01:03:25,835
Listen to this - the might
of his fart in verse

817
01:03:26,418 --> 01:03:28,918
A good loud fart is honorable

818
01:03:29,168 --> 01:03:31,501
'Fart'? Go, Silencer

819
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:34,543
A medium fart is tolerable

820
01:03:37,876 --> 01:03:41,418
Softer windbreaks are terrible

821
01:03:44,418 --> 01:03:49,293
And the silent ones unbearable

822
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,376
That's what mindless cramming
does to you

823
01:04:02,585 --> 01:04:06,043
Cramming may see you
through four years of college

824
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:10,126
but it will 'screw' you
for the next 40 years

825
01:04:11,376 --> 01:04:13,960
He still doesn't get it

826
01:04:20,126 --> 01:04:24,460
'Medium fart is tolerable'…
Unbelievable!

827
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:27,376
You're a poet, Rancho.
How did you think of this?

828
01:04:28,835 --> 01:04:32,210
That was fun.
He didn't know what hit him

829
01:04:34,751 --> 01:04:38,043
You swines!
What did I ever do to you?

830
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:43,043
Sorry man.
Don't take it personally

831
01:04:43,335 --> 01:04:44,543
I will

832
01:04:45,168 --> 01:04:48,001
Chatur Ramalingam
will never forget this insult

833
01:04:48,668 --> 01:04:52,501
I'll think of it every minute,
every second of my life

834
01:04:52,835 --> 01:04:58,168
Sorry man. That was a demo
for Raju - Don't cram blindly

835
01:04:58,543 --> 01:05:00,710
Understand and enjoy
the wonders of Science

836
01:05:00,876 --> 01:05:03,335
I'm not here to enjoy Science

837
01:05:03,501 --> 01:05:06,376
So You're here to screw Science

838
01:05:08,085 --> 01:05:11,043
Go ahead. Laugh at my methods

839
01:05:12,168 --> 01:05:16,460
But one day these methods
will bring me success

840
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,793
That day I'll laugh and you'll cry

841
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:25,460
You're on the wrong track again.
Don't chase success

842
01:05:26,376 --> 01:05:28,543
Become a good engineer
and success will chase you

843
01:05:28,793 --> 01:05:33,376
These ideals don't work
in the real world

844
01:05:34,251 --> 01:05:38,210
You take your train, I'll take mine

845
01:05:39,043 --> 01:05:42,293
Ten years from now
we'll meet at the same station

846
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:48,126
Same day. Same place.
We'll see who's more successful

847
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,835
you … or I

848
01:05:51,626 --> 01:05:55,918
Have the balls? C'mon, bet!

849
01:05:56,168 --> 01:05:59,710
It's a challenge

850
01:06:01,043 --> 01:06:02,043
Watch it!

851
01:06:08,585 --> 01:06:09,585
What's he writing?

852
01:06:17,126 --> 01:06:19,376
Don't forget this date

853
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:30,251
I'm not used to
such expensive gifts, Suhas

854
01:06:30,626 --> 01:06:31,835
Get used to them, Pia

855
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:34,085
You're gonna be
Suhas Tandon's wife

856
01:06:34,251 --> 01:06:35,335
Where's the bill, man?

857
01:06:39,835 --> 01:06:40,835
I'll be back

858
01:06:51,126 --> 01:06:52,875
- You changed the speech?
- What?

859
01:06:52,876 --> 01:06:53,876
Don't lie

860
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,293
Um … Yeah

861
01:06:56,543 --> 01:06:58,918
What's your problem with dad?
I have no problem

862
01:06:59,418 --> 01:07:02,210
I'm making an inverter
named after him. Look … Oh

863
01:07:06,585 --> 01:07:08,043
Why're you harassing him?

864
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,480
'Cause he runs a factory,
not a college

865
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:14,293
Churning out asses.
Like that one

866
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,460
She destroyed it, man

867
01:07:23,876 --> 01:07:25,085
How dare you call him an ass?

868
01:07:25,335 --> 01:07:28,585
He is one!
First Engineering, then MBA

869
01:07:28,751 --> 01:07:30,501
then becomes a banker in the USA

870
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,918
Because it rakes in more money?

871
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:36,710
Life for him is just
a profit-loss statement

872
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:38,960
He sees profit in you,
so he's with you

873
01:07:39,335 --> 01:07:42,960
Director's daughter, doctor in the
making … Good for his image!

874
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:44,543
It's not you he cares for

875
01:07:46,835 --> 01:07:48,168
Who do you think you are?

876
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,085
What do you mean
he doesn't care for me?

877
01:07:52,043 --> 01:07:54,001
New watch? One moment

878
01:07:55,251 --> 01:07:57,293
You always need a demo

879
01:07:58,376 --> 01:07:59,376
Hey Suhas

880
01:08:01,376 --> 01:08:02,918
Where were you?

881
01:08:03,376 --> 01:08:05,001
She's looking for her watch

882
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:06,960
What? You lost the watch

883
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:08,376
Never mind. Get another

884
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:09,960
It cost 400,000!

885
01:08:12,043 --> 01:08:13,960
Mine's just 250/-
but keeps the same time

886
01:08:14,168 --> 01:08:16,460
Keep quiet … How could
you be so careless, Pia

887
01:08:16,668 --> 01:08:19,751
This callous attitude is
disgusting. It's disrespectful

888
01:08:19,918 --> 01:08:22,460
That was a limited edition watch

889
01:08:22,876 --> 01:08:26,293
Now wear your ancient
piece of junk at dinner

890
01:08:27,668 --> 01:08:29,043
What're you staring at?

891
01:08:32,043 --> 01:08:34,751
Here come the tears!
Real mature, Pia

892
01:08:35,335 --> 01:08:36,543
I can't handle this

893
01:08:37,418 --> 01:08:39,501
Stop crying and look for it

894
01:08:53,043 --> 01:08:55,918
Find another wrist
for this watch … Ass!

895
01:09:02,376 --> 01:09:05,001
Hey, you're awesome.
Called him an ass to his face

896
01:09:05,293 --> 01:09:06,293
Get lost

897
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,085
It's too noisy here

898
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:10,335
She's saying 'Thank you',
I hear 'Get lost'

899
01:09:10,543 --> 01:09:13,335
I said 'Get lost'
Don't get so uptight

900
01:09:13,751 --> 01:09:16,460
Actually, you never
really loved him

901
01:09:16,918 --> 01:09:17,918
What do you mean?

902
01:09:18,168 --> 01:09:22,918
When you see him, do the
winds whisper a melody?

903
01:09:24,501 --> 01:09:26,085
Your scarf flies in slow motion?

904
01:09:27,126 --> 01:09:28,835
The Moon appears gigantic?

905
01:09:29,376 --> 01:09:31,918
That happens in movies, not in life

906
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:35,085
Happens in life too -
if you love a person

907
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,501
… not an ass

908
01:09:41,918 --> 01:09:46,543
Hello. What?

909
01:09:47,668 --> 01:09:51,126
Oh God! Ok, I'm on my way

910
01:09:54,376 --> 01:09:56,375
You're a medical student,
right? Need your help

911
01:09:56,376 --> 01:09:58,043
It's an emergency, please What?

912
01:09:58,585 --> 01:10:01,751
Please come with me.
What's that oath you doctors take -

913
01:10:02,001 --> 01:10:04,626
You'll never deny a patient help …
The Hippocratic Oath

914
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:07,126
Please help me,
it's an emergency

915
01:10:11,668 --> 01:10:14,793
You gatecrash my sister's wedding,
break off my engagement …

916
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,543
my dad is popping
BP pills because of you …

917
01:10:18,085 --> 01:10:19,626
and here I am, helping you!

918
01:10:20,793 --> 01:10:21,960
Unbelievable!

919
01:10:23,168 --> 01:10:27,001
This Hippocratic Oath -
It's really done us in!

920
01:10:31,876 --> 01:10:33,751
Where's Raju, ma'am?
Gone to get a cab

921
01:10:34,168 --> 01:10:35,626
Called the ambulance
two hours ago

922
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,501
In this country,
pizza reaches in 30 minutes

923
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:39,751
but an ambulance …!

924
01:10:39,918 --> 01:10:42,168
He needs hospitalization.
Urgently

925
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,335
Hey stop!

926
01:10:59,668 --> 01:11:01,876
Move, it's an emergency!

927
01:11:03,543 --> 01:11:04,626
Move … move …

928
01:11:06,626 --> 01:11:07,668
Move … move …

929
01:11:11,751 --> 01:11:13,876
Doctor, emergency!

930
01:11:15,501 --> 01:11:16,501
That's the patient

931
01:11:22,376 --> 01:11:24,418
Keep this. Hey, here's Raju

932
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,835
What the hell!
You brought dad on the scooter

933
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:30,043
Should I've sent him by courier?

934
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:33,251
No wisecracks on dads profession!
Where is he?

935
01:11:33,876 --> 01:11:35,668
Go ask the doctor

936
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:39,876
Close call, Pia. A little delay,
we'd have lost him

937
01:11:40,293 --> 01:11:41,936
Glad you didn't wait for an ambulance
and got him on the scooter

938
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,710
Call me if there's a problem

939
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:56,835
Rancho! Thank you …

940
01:11:58,626 --> 01:12:01,626
Thanking your buddies!
Silencer teaching you manners?

941
01:12:02,876 --> 01:12:05,918
Didn't he teach you -
A friend is man's greatest bosom?

942
01:12:07,751 --> 01:12:10,626
Go on now.
You have an exam tomorrow

943
01:12:11,251 --> 01:12:14,460
Exams we have many …
Dad mostly just one

944
01:12:16,168 --> 01:12:18,418
We won't budge from here
without the Postmaster

945
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:20,085
Don't worry

946
01:12:27,085 --> 01:12:31,210
Rancho, forgive me. I was scared

947
01:12:31,501 --> 01:12:33,585
It's ok. Quiet, now

948
01:12:36,168 --> 01:12:38,293
Please forgive me

949
01:12:44,918 --> 01:12:48,918
It's ok, calm down.
Go see your dad

950
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:50,835
And don't go
with that weepy face

951
01:12:57,168 --> 01:12:58,168
Thanks buddy

952
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:14,501
Natty scooter. Saved a life.
How much does it cost?

953
01:13:14,835 --> 01:13:17,126
Pour some mint sauce
on it. It'll tell you

954
01:13:19,793 --> 01:13:21,668
Hey, happy Independence Day

955
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,626
Today isn't Independence Day

956
01:13:24,001 --> 01:13:27,126
For you it is! Now you're free
to wear your mom's watch

957
01:13:27,793 --> 01:13:30,501
No ass can say it's an
ancient piece of junk

958

Hey

959
01:13:35,668 --> 01:13:37,626
How do you know
it was mom's watch?

960
01:13:39,418 --> 01:13:41,835
At your sister's wedding,
you wore sparkling new clothes

961
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:43,835
Only the watch was old

962
01:13:44,501 --> 01:13:45,501
What could that mean?

963
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:50,835
You really missed your mom
that day, didn't you?

964
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:54,710
Yes

965
01:13:55,793 --> 01:13:57,501
Your mom must've been
really beautiful

966
01:14:00,085 --> 01:14:02,210
Yes. How do you know?

967
01:14:02,501 --> 01:14:03,501

01:14:05,043 --> 01:14:06,668
'Life is a race. If you don't run fast

No, stupid

I'm here.
It's a matter of three hours

1019
01:18:48,543 --> 01:18:51,168
Take my scooter.

Go

01:19:24,043 --> 01:19:26,418
Sorry, we're late
It was an emergency

1024
01:19:32,335 --> 01:19:33,418
Settle down there

1025
01:19:38,001 --> 01:19:39,210
Sir, they're still writing

1026

Hello. Time up

Please, five minutes.
We started half an hour late

Prime Ministers son? Even then …

1037
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:23,501
I will not accept your paper

1038
01:20:25,043 --> 01:20:27,001
Do you know
our names and roll numbers?

1039

Hey, what's your roll number?

1043
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:43,418
Where the hell are their papers?

1044
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,875

1047
01:20:58,751 --> 01:21:03,626
Sir Snake, bless my Physics.
I promise a pint of milk per day

1050
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,585
Watch over my results

1051
01:21:12,835 --> 01:21:16,668

1055
01:21:26,376 --> 01:21:28,460

1056
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:31,210

Second last

1058

Rancho?

1059
01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:42,751
Not there

1060
01:21:44,168 --> 01:21:45,168
My heart sank

1061
01:21:45,793 --> 01:21:50,168
Not 'cause our ranks tanked,
but 'cause our friend flunked

1062
01:21:52,668 --> 01:21:56,335
There's a mistake.
It's not possible. It's injustice

1063

What's Silencer howling about?

1064
01:22:04,043 --> 01:22:05,043
He got the second rank

1065
01:22:07,335 --> 01:22:08,335
Who's first?

1066
01:22:09,585 --> 01:22:10,668
Rancho

1067
01:22:13,585 --> 01:22:14,585
Rancho?

1068
01:22:16,918 --> 01:22:17,918
Move aside

1069

1072
01:22:37,376 --> 01:22:41,210
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.

01:22:41,876 --> 01:22:44,126
Uday Sinha. Second row. Third seat

1074
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:48,293
Alok Mittal. Second row. Fifth seat

1075
01:22:50,126 --> 01:22:52,751
Sahili Rao. Third row …

1076
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,376
Sir, why this seating
according to rank?

1077
01:22:56,585 --> 01:22:57,793
Any problem with that?

1078
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:02,043
Yes, this grading system is
like a caste system

1079
01:23:02,543 --> 01:23:05,668
A-graders: Masters
C-graders: Slaves

1080
01:23:06,001 --> 01:23:09,251
It's not nice, sir
You have a better idea?

1081
01:23:09,876 --> 01:23:14,001
Yes. Results should not be
displayed at all

1082
01:23:14,501 --> 01:23:18,543
Why publicise someone's flaws?

1083
01:23:18,876 --> 01:23:23,876
If your iron count is low,
will the doctor prescribe tonic …

1084
01:23:24,043 --> 01:23:25,460

1085

You see, sir?

1086
01:23:28,001 --> 01:23:29,751
So basically,
what you are saying is

1087
01:23:30,293 --> 01:23:32,053
I should personally go to
each student's room

1088
01:23:33,126 --> 01:23:34,168
and whisper in his ears …

1089
01:23:35,251 --> 01:23:37,750
'You have come first';
'You're second';

1090
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:39,293
'Oh, I'm so sorry,
you have failed'

1091
01:23:42,335 --> 01:23:46,668
No sir, I mean
grades create a divide

1092
01:23:49,043 --> 01:23:50,960
I've topped, so I'm next to you

1093
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:53,626
My pals came last,
they're in the back corner

1094
01:23:53,835 --> 01:23:55,335
At least they're in the corner

1095
01:23:55,501 --> 01:23:57,876
More time with you, and
they'll be out of the photo

1096
01:23:59,043 --> 01:24:01,001
They will neither pass,
nor get a job

1097
01:24:01,835 --> 01:24:05,668
They'll get jobs, sir.
There must be some firm that …

1098
01:24:06,168 --> 01:24:07,960
prefers humans to machines

1099
01:24:09,876 --> 01:24:11,668
They'll get jobs. I guarantee

1100
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:16,001
You guarantee it!

1101
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:17,751
Bet, sir?

1102
01:24:21,168 --> 01:24:22,460
Govind - Yes, sir?

1103
01:24:26,668 --> 01:24:29,918
Even if one of them gets
a job in campus interviews …

1104
01:24:31,168 --> 01:24:32,335
shave off my moustache

1105
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:35,960
Sir!

1106
01:24:36,293 --> 01:24:39,293
- Happy?
- Smile, please

1107
01:24:40,626 --> 01:24:41,626
Happy, sir

1108
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,501
Jackass!
Honking to hide your tooting

1109
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,751
Septic tank! Popping pills again?

1110
01:24:53,043 --> 01:24:55,668
I didn't do it … Raju?

1111
01:24:55,918 --> 01:24:57,625
This is a familiar stink

1112
01:24:57,626 --> 01:25:00,626
He's the sole cause for
global warming

1113
01:25:25,918 --> 01:25:28,501
Toss me your wallet - I'll buy pants

1114
01:25:29,126 --> 01:25:33,251
Take Chatur's suit instead
Don't touch my suit

1115
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,210
Rancho'll recognize you
even in underwear

1116
01:25:36,418 --> 01:25:40,376
Where's this?
If I could read, would I sell peanuts?

1117
01:25:40,626 --> 01:25:43,168
He can't read - But he can speak

1118
01:25:43,418 --> 01:25:47,376
Wait. Do you know a
Ranchhoddas Chanchad?

1119
01:25:47,626 --> 01:25:49,335
Yes, he lives there

1120
01:25:50,043 --> 01:25:55,335
<i>Free as the wind was he</i>

1121
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:02,751
<i>Like a soaring kite was he</i>

1122
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,710
<i>Where did he go …</i>

1123
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,168
<i>let's find him</i>

1124
01:26:09,335 --> 01:26:12,042
Chatur, your pills
Thanks. Where were they?

1125
01:26:12,043 --> 01:26:14,543
In the pocket - Hey, my pants!

1126
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:16,668
Karl Marx says to
share all resources

1127
01:26:18,293 --> 01:26:20,210
Hey, you'll give people ideas

1128
01:26:21,793 --> 01:26:22,793
I want it now

1129
01:26:38,085 --> 01:26:39,168
What happened?

1130
01:26:41,335 --> 01:26:42,501
Rancho's father

1131
01:26:46,043 --> 01:26:48,751
Excuse me, where is Ranchhoddas?

1132
01:26:49,626 --> 01:26:52,001
There he is - Thank you

1133
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:18,335
Rancho … - Yes?

1134
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,626
Sorry. We're looking for Ranchhoddas

1135
01:27:23,668 --> 01:27:24,960
I am Ranchhoddas

1136
01:27:25,585 --> 01:27:29,460
No, I mean … 'Ranchhoddas
Shamaldas Chanchad'

1137
01:27:30,918 --> 01:27:33,460
Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad. That's me

1138
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,210
Ranchhoddas, take care, son

1139
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:02,626
'Ranchhoddas Chanchad'

1140
01:28:09,835 --> 01:28:10,835
Raju

1141
01:28:43,126 --> 01:28:46,710
I'll be in the Guinness Book for
driving Delhi-Shimla in underwear

1142
01:28:46,876 --> 01:28:47,996
That too, for the wrong guy!

1143
01:28:48,501 --> 01:28:52,418
Same name, same degree,
same photo, but a different guy

1144
01:28:53,043 --> 01:28:54,460
What's going on?

1145
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:57,835
How did Silencer get
Rancho's address?

1146
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:00,043
Good point!

1147
01:29:01,335 --> 01:29:02,710
Hey Chatur, come here

1148
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:12,376
How dare you open this?
I got this from San Francisco

1149
01:29:12,585 --> 01:29:14,085
Handmade biscuits

1150
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,168
Specially for Mr. Phunsukh Wangdu

1151
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:20,709
Phunsukh Bangdu? Who's that?

1152
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:25,417
Not Bangdu. Wangdu. 'W'.
Phunsukh Wangdu

1153
01:29:25,418 --> 01:29:28,334
Do you know who that is?
He's a great scientist

1154
01:29:28,335 --> 01:29:31,001
400 patents. The world wants him

1155
01:29:32,085 --> 01:29:35,501
Took me a year
to get an appointment

1156
01:29:36,293 --> 01:29:41,834
Once he signs the deal with
my company, I'll be huge!

1157
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:45,960
Forget Wangdu.
How'd you get Rancho's address?

1158
01:29:46,126 --> 01:29:48,043
You should be thanking
Phunsukh Wangdu

1159
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:52,001
He led me to Rancho, See this

1160
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:58,750
My secretary was here to fix
an appointment with Wangdu

1161
01:29:58,751 --> 01:30:03,043
She didn't get the appointment.
But I found Rancho

1162
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:08,875
I checked the Shimla directory
and found Rancho's name

1163
01:30:08,876 --> 01:30:10,501
What happened to his face?

1164
01:30:10,918 --> 01:30:13,210
Plastic surgery
in honor of your visit?

1165
01:30:17,626 --> 01:30:19,418
Only one man has the answer

1166
01:30:20,043 --> 01:30:24,668
Sorry Papa,
I couldn't fulfill your last wish

1167
01:30:26,168 --> 01:30:29,918
You kept asking me
to take you on pilgrimage

1168
01:30:30,876 --> 01:30:33,335
But I waited
for the highway tender

1169
01:30:34,876 --> 01:30:39,293
There the tender opened,
here you closed your eyes

1170
01:30:43,418 --> 01:30:47,876
I am so sorry, Papa.
I could not be a good son …

1171
01:30:48,085 --> 01:30:49,376
Wrong

1172
01:30:49,876 --> 01:30:52,668
You're an engineer.
Your degree's on the wall!

1173
01:30:53,001 --> 01:30:54,251
You were a very good son

1174
01:30:56,918 --> 01:31:01,626
How dare you barge in?
I'll have you arrested

1175
01:31:01,835 --> 01:31:05,001
No, you'll be arrested.
We've made enquiries

1176
01:31:05,335 --> 01:31:08,376
You use the degree
to clinch contracts

1177
01:31:08,876 --> 01:31:12,085
It's our friend's degree.
How did you get it?

1178
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:29,085
This is a 150 acre estate

1179
01:31:29,543 --> 01:31:32,710
If I shoot and bury you,
no one would even notice

1180
01:31:33,085 --> 01:31:34,085
Get the point?

1181
01:31:35,335 --> 01:31:36,335
Now get lost

1182
01:31:41,793 --> 01:31:46,043
I'm taking Papa's ashes to the
sacred river. Can take yours too

1183
01:31:53,543 --> 01:31:55,085
Grab Papa!

1184
01:31:58,043 --> 01:31:59,126
Here, here

1185
01:32:03,293 --> 01:32:04,293
Let go of Papa!

1186
01:32:07,251 --> 01:32:10,043
Tell the truth or
Papa is flushed!

1187
01:32:10,210 --> 01:32:13,085
Hand over Papa
Papa goes to the sacred sewer

1188
01:32:13,835 --> 01:32:17,126
Get Papa out of the potty
You pull trigger, I pull flush.

1189
01:32:17,293 --> 01:32:18,667
I'll count to three

1190
01:32:18,668 --> 01:32:22,376
Wanna shoot us?
Raju, scatter the ashes

1191
01:32:25,085 --> 01:32:26,085
One

1192
01:32:26,251 --> 01:32:30,960
Take us down,
and Papa's down the drain

1193
01:32:32,251 --> 01:32:33,251
Two

1194
01:32:33,252 --> 01:32:35,668
Then grope for him in the gutter

1195
01:32:35,835 --> 01:32:36,835
What is it, Raju?

1196
01:32:38,126 --> 01:32:40,585
We've got the wrong urn.
It's empty!

1197
01:32:41,501 --> 01:32:42,501
Empty?

1198
01:32:43,793 --> 01:32:47,210
Empty - we'll empty it out!

1199
01:32:47,376 --> 01:32:48,335
No, no!

1200
01:32:48,336 --> 01:32:51,292
We'll empty it out

1201
01:32:51,293 --> 01:32:53,710
No … hands up!

1202
01:32:56,043 --> 01:32:59,043
Who are you?

1203
01:32:59,251 --> 01:33:00,335
I am Rancho

1204
01:33:01,668 --> 01:33:04,085
I swear on Papa, it's true

1205
01:33:04,335 --> 01:33:06,085
I am Rancho! That was Chhote.

1206
01:33:07,251 --> 01:33:08,251
Chhote?

1207
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:14,418
He was our gardener's son, Chhote

1208
01:33:16,418 --> 01:33:19,210
He stayed on with us
after he was orphaned

1209
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:29,251
Did odd jobs around the house,
ran errands

1210
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:31,960
He had a passion for learning

1211
01:33:35,251 --> 01:33:37,876
<i>He'd wear my old uniform
and slip into school</i>

1212
01:33:39,918 --> 01:33:42,835
<i>And attend any class he liked.
It suited me</i>

1213
01:33:43,835 --> 01:33:49,876
<i>I made him do my homework,
take my exams</i>

1214
01:33:50,418 --> 01:33:53,418
<i>It was going well, till
one day …</i>

1215
01:33:53,876 --> 01:33:58,500
<i>Our teacher saw a sixth grader
doing tenth grade math</i>

1216
01:33:58,501 --> 01:34:00,001
Which grade are you in, son?

1217
01:34:01,251 --> 01:34:02,418
What's your name?

1218
01:34:03,418 --> 01:34:04,418
<i>We got caught</i>

1219
01:34:05,543 --> 01:34:06,876
<i>Papa was a powerful man, so …</i>

1220
01:34:07,043 --> 01:34:10,501
<i>our teacher alerted him
before going to the Principal</i>

1221
01:34:11,043 --> 01:34:14,960
You started it, you will finish it

1222
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:20,460
People pretend to show me respect

1223
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:23,376
But behind my back …

1224
01:34:24,376 --> 01:34:25,960
mock me as an illiterate

1225
01:34:27,001 --> 01:34:29,001
I won't let that happen to my son

1226
01:34:30,126 --> 01:34:34,418
This boy wants to study.
I want just a degree

1227
01:34:35,001 --> 01:34:36,918
Let the game go on

1228
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,543
Make this kid an engineer

1229
01:34:40,835 --> 01:34:46,168
and I'll have a degree
in my son's name on that wall

1230
01:34:46,543 --> 01:34:50,501
I went to London for four years,
he went to college as me

1231
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:58,335
He'd promised to cut contact with all
after getting the degree

1232
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:08,501
But he always said,
'Two idiots will come looking for me'

1233
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:15,335
He really misses you both

1234
01:35:17,793 --> 01:35:21,710
I'll give you his address,
go to him

1235
01:35:25,085 --> 01:35:28,543
But please keep my secret

1236
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:31,585
What secret?

1237
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,418
You got the wrong urn, sir.
Papa is in here

1238
01:35:50,668 --> 01:35:53,292
What the hell's going on?
Who was that gun guy?

1239
01:35:53,293 --> 01:35:56,875
Complicated story.
Without subtitles. Not for you

1240
01:35:56,876 --> 01:35:59,126
Ignore it - Where're we going?

1241
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:01,460
Ladakh

1242
01:36:01,461 --> 01:36:02,793
Ladakh! Why?

1243
01:36:03,543 --> 01:36:04,543
To meet Rancho

1244
01:36:04,668 --> 01:36:07,709
What's he doing in Ladakh?

1245
01:36:07,710 --> 01:36:11,251
No clue. We have
the address of a school

1246
01:36:11,543 --> 01:36:14,585
School teacher!

1247
01:36:15,501 --> 01:36:18,876
I'm Vice President of
Rockledge Corporation, and he …

1248
01:36:19,335 --> 01:36:21,585
A for Apple, B for Ball …

1249
01:36:21,793 --> 01:36:22,960
D for Donkey

1250
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:28,626
Next week I sign a huge deal
with Phunsukh Wangdu

1251
01:36:28,835 --> 01:36:31,835
And he … A for Apple, B for Ball …

1252
01:36:35,585 --> 01:36:37,960
<i>Today my respect
for that idiot shot up</i>

1253
01:36:38,918 --> 01:36:41,210
<i>Most of us went to college
just for a degree</i>

1254
01:36:41,835 --> 01:36:46,001
<i>No degree meant
no plum job, no pretty wife …</i>

1255
01:36:46,335 --> 01:36:48,876
<i>no credit card, no social status</i>

1256
01:36:49,585 --> 01:36:51,376
<i>None of this mattered to him</i>

1257
01:36:51,543 --> 01:36:53,335
<i>He was in college
for the joy of learning</i>

1258
01:36:53,876 --> 01:36:57,126
<i>He never cared
if he was first or last</i>

1259
01:36:57,751 --> 01:37:00,043
Who was the first man
on the Moon?

1260
01:37:00,335 --> 01:37:01,625
Neil Armstrong, sir

1261
01:37:01,626 --> 01:37:03,751
Obviously, it is Neil Armstrong.
We all know it

1262
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,168
Who was the second?

1263
01:37:05,710 --> 01:37:07,310
Don't waste your time.
It's not important

1264
01:37:07,793 --> 01:37:10,251
Nobody remembers the man
who ever came second

1265
01:37:11,418 --> 01:37:16,835
Soon, 26 companies
will be here with job offers

1266
01:37:17,335 --> 01:37:22,960
You'll have a job
even before your final exam

1267
01:37:23,751 --> 01:37:25,585
This is your last lap, my friends

1268
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:28,250
Put the pedal to the metal.
Step on the gas

1269
01:37:28,251 --> 01:37:30,210
Go out there and make history!

1270
01:37:33,668 --> 01:37:34,876
Any questions?

1271
01:37:37,418 --> 01:37:38,418
Yes?

1272
01:37:39,668 --> 01:37:43,251
Sir, suppose a student gets a job …

1273
01:37:43,668 --> 01:37:50,918
but narrowly fails the final exam,
will he still have the job?

1274
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:52,751
Very good question

1275
01:37:56,043 --> 01:37:58,376
Anyone else
with the same question?

1276
01:38:00,335 --> 01:38:01,626
As expected

1277
01:38:04,001 --> 01:38:07,085
Please come on stage.
Give them a big hand

1278
01:38:18,293 --> 01:38:20,625
For the last four years

1279
01:38:20,626 --> 01:38:23,543
they've been our most
consistent students

1280
01:38:23,710 --> 01:38:27,001
Consistently last in every exam

1281
01:38:27,876 --> 01:38:29,210
Come my geniuses, come

1282
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:36,293
Their brains will fetch
a handsome price

1283
01:38:37,043 --> 01:38:40,043
'Cause they're completely unused

1284
01:38:42,585 --> 01:38:43,793
And to answer their question -

1285
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:47,501
The exam won't affect their jobs

1286
01:38:48,335 --> 01:38:51,835
Because no company
will hire them anyway!

1287
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:55,710
They're so unique, their
names will be writ in gold -

1288
01:38:56,043 --> 01:38:59,042
'Farhanitrate' and 'Prerajulization'

1289
01:38:59,043 --> 01:39:00,563
Give them a big hand,
please, everybody

1290
01:39:09,626 --> 01:39:14,460
He screwed us!

1291
01:39:14,626 --> 01:39:16,543
In front of everyone

1292
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:22,917
God, I'll give up meat,
light a 1000 incense sticks

1293
01:39:22,918 --> 01:39:24,792
Do me just one favor -

1294
01:39:24,793 --> 01:39:27,210
Delete Virus!

1295
01:39:28,876 --> 01:39:30,835
Burn him in hell

1296
01:39:32,251 --> 01:39:36,043
Fry Virus-nuggets in bubbling oil

1297
01:39:36,835 --> 01:39:39,668
You think God is a contract killer?

1298
01:39:40,335 --> 01:39:41,585
You shut up

1299
01:39:42,335 --> 01:39:45,292
You're in the center
of the photo every year

1300
01:39:45,293 --> 01:39:47,210
We're rotting in the corner

1301
01:39:48,293 --> 01:39:51,293
This year we may fall
out of the photo altogether

1302
01:39:53,793 --> 01:39:55,585
- Know why I come first?
- Why?

1303
01:39:56,043 --> 01:39:57,710
Because I love machines

1304
01:39:58,543 --> 01:40:00,335
Engineering is my passion

1305
01:40:01,418 --> 01:40:02,626
Know your passion?

1306
01:40:05,501 --> 01:40:07,168
That's my bag - Be quiet

1307
01:40:08,168 --> 01:40:09,460
What're you up to?

1308
01:40:11,918 --> 01:40:14,043
This … is your passion

1309
01:40:15,335 --> 01:40:16,710
Go post this letter

1310
01:40:17,126 --> 01:40:18,418
What letter?

1311
01:40:21,168 --> 01:40:25,418
5 years ago he wrote this for
his favorite wildlife photographer

1312
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:28,960
Andre … - Istvan

1313
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:33,543
He wanted to train with him
in Hungary

1314
01:40:34,501 --> 01:40:37,793
But in fear of his dad, the Fuhrer,
never posted it

1315
01:40:39,543 --> 01:40:43,085
Quit Engineering, marry Photography

1316
01:40:44,085 --> 01:40:46,043
Follow your talent

1317
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:53,210
If Michael Jackson's dad
forced him to be a boxer …

1318
01:40:54,043 --> 01:40:57,543
and Mohammad Ali's dad
pushed him to be a singer …

1319
01:40:58,293 --> 01:40:59,585
imagine the disaster

1320
01:41:01,668 --> 01:41:04,168
Do you get it?

1321
01:41:07,751 --> 01:41:11,043
Idiot! Loves Photography,
but is marrying machines

1322
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:17,085
Your Holiness Guru Ranchhoddas

1323
01:41:18,418 --> 01:41:22,543
Engineering is
my wife and mistress both

1324
01:41:24,001 --> 01:41:26,501
- But I still fail. Why?
- Explain

1325
01:41:27,668 --> 01:41:30,001
'Cause you're a coward,
scared of the future

1326
01:41:31,751 --> 01:41:36,210
Look at this -
more holy rings than fingers

1327
01:41:36,793 --> 01:41:39,960
One ring per fear -
exam, sis's dowry, job

1328
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:45,210
With such fear of tomorrow,
how'll you live today?

1329
01:41:46,085 --> 01:41:47,710
How'll you focus on studies?

1330
01:41:49,085 --> 01:41:52,168
Strange buddies! One lives
in fear, the other in pretense

1331
01:41:53,168 --> 01:41:58,501
You live in both - fear and pretense

1332
01:41:58,751 --> 01:42:04,793
You're scared to tell Pia you
love her … so you pretend you don't

1333
01:42:07,335 --> 01:42:09,376
What rubbish!

1334
01:42:10,043 --> 01:42:14,209
Easy to offer free advice,
tough to follow it

1335
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:17,418
Have the guts? Go confess to Pia.

1336
01:42:17,918 --> 01:42:21,875
There's no connection!
Deep connection, Your Holiness

1337
01:42:21,876 --> 01:42:27,335
Listen, if you confess to Pia

1338
01:42:27,793 --> 01:42:32,210
I'll tell Dad - No Engineering,
I'm marrying Photography

1339
01:42:33,418 --> 01:42:37,043
And I'll dump my rings
before the job interview

1340
01:42:37,501 --> 01:42:38,543
Deal?

1341
01:42:40,668 --> 01:42:42,418
Have the guts?

1342
01:42:42,585 --> 01:42:44,835
His Holiness is speechless

1343
01:42:50,918 --> 01:42:51,918
Let's go

1344
01:42:56,835 --> 01:42:58,126
Follow me - Where?

1345
01:43:03,793 --> 01:43:05,293
Let's go

1346
01:43:05,751 --> 01:43:08,959
Hey Virus! I'm anti-Virus

1347
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,418
Hope no dog here

1348
01:43:10,585 --> 01:43:12,960
Cowards! Let's go

1349
01:43:13,126 --> 01:43:16,793
If any danger,
I'll give the Virus alert

1350
01:43:29,085 --> 01:43:30,626
Beware - Virus inside

1351
01:43:51,251 --> 01:43:52,418
Need background score?

1352
01:43:52,668 --> 01:43:53,668
Pia - Who's it?

1353
01:43:56,418 --> 01:44:00,085
Don't yell! It's me, Rancho

1354
01:44:02,043 --> 01:44:05,418
Just listen for a moment,
then I'm gone

1355
01:44:05,751 --> 01:44:08,126
<i>Say not a word …</i>

1356
01:44:08,501 --> 01:44:09,501
Pia … - Yes?

1357
01:44:11,626 --> 01:44:14,918
Those 22 minutes with you
on the scooter

1358
01:44:15,793 --> 01:44:20,335
were the most enchanting
22 minutes of my life

1359
01:44:24,793 --> 01:44:30,168
I could spend an eternity
with you on the scooter

1360
01:44:30,335 --> 01:44:31,335
Wow

1361
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:35,543
<i>… and time stands still</i>

1362
01:44:36,626 --> 01:44:44,043
Every night you ride into my dreams
on your scooter, dressed as a bride

1363
01:44:47,043 --> 01:44:49,335
Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet

1364
01:44:52,835 --> 01:44:55,751
and come close to kiss me

1365
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:01,126
But that kiss doesn't happen

1366
01:45:02,001 --> 01:45:03,001
Why?

1367
01:45:03,251 --> 01:45:06,376
Because the noses collide,
and I wake up

1368
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:09,126
The noses never collide, stupid!

1369
01:45:14,293 --> 01:45:17,335
I'm sorry,
I thought you were Pia

1370
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:18,960
I wish I was

1371
01:45:19,210 --> 01:45:20,960
Sis, why did you interrupt?

1372
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:23,251
It took him four years
to say this

1373
01:45:23,501 --> 01:45:26,625
Pia, kiss him.
Show that noses don't collide

1374
01:45:26,626 --> 01:45:29,835
You have my permission,
kiss him … He's so cute!

1375
01:45:30,418 --> 01:45:32,043
- Who's this?
- My sister

1376
01:45:33,085 --> 01:45:34,085
Who're you?

1377
01:45:43,793 --> 01:45:47,584
When you were talking,
he kicked. First time!

1378
01:45:47,585 --> 01:45:51,376
He? How do you know
it's a 'he' or 'she'?

1379
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:55,710
Papa asked the astrologer If we'd
get an engineer or a doctor

1380
01:45:56,710 --> 01:45:57,710
Meaning?

1381
01:45:57,793 --> 01:46:00,626
Boy becomes an engineer,
girl a doctor

1382
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:06,918
Champ, better stay inside.
Out here's a circus

1383
01:46:08,043 --> 01:46:11,751
Your grandpa is the ringmaster.
He'll crack his whip -

1384
01:46:11,918 --> 01:46:17,293
'Run! Life is a race.
Be an engineer'

1385
01:46:18,168 --> 01:46:23,376
But you follow your heart.
If grandpa scares you …

1386
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:27,543
put your hand on your heart
and say, 'All is well'

1387
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:29,460
He kicked

1388
01:46:31,251 --> 01:46:32,293
Say it again

1389
01:46:33,543 --> 01:46:35,126
All is well

1390
01:46:36,043 --> 01:46:37,710
Kicked again

1391
01:46:39,376 --> 01:46:42,335
Once more - All is well

1392
01:46:46,876 --> 01:46:51,001
All is well

1393
01:46:51,585 --> 01:46:52,585
Who is it?

1394
01:46:53,418 --> 01:46:54,418
Go

1395
01:46:55,085 --> 01:47:00,209
You sent hate-mail to Dad,
here's pee-mail for you

1396
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:04,626
Enjoy the pee-mail, happy reading!

1397
01:47:11,126 --> 01:47:13,835
Who is it? Your future sonin-law

1398
01:47:14,126 --> 01:47:15,585
And the wedding party

1399
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:17,501
Rastogi!

1400
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:21,751
Security, that way

1401
01:47:51,376 --> 01:47:55,085
So you all have already learned
about the simple pendulum

1402
01:47:55,835 --> 01:47:59,710
Now let's get down to the advanced
study about compound pendulum

1403
01:48:01,168 --> 01:48:05,126
It's an irregular object
oscillating about its own axis

1404
01:48:05,585 --> 01:48:06,626
Let me demonstrate to you

1405
01:48:07,251 --> 01:48:09,168
- What's this?
- Pencil

1406
01:48:09,501 --> 01:48:11,000
- What's inside?
- Lead

1407
01:48:11,001 --> 01:48:13,126
Good. Lead is the axis to this pencil

1408
01:48:13,668 --> 01:48:16,626
Even you can be a compound
pendulum, if you oscillate about …

1409
01:48:24,293 --> 01:48:26,876
Where is Raju Rastogi?
Present, sir

1410
01:48:34,376 --> 01:48:36,251
Hi. Everybody is here

1411
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:39,001
Good morning, sir

1412
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:41,126
Where were you last night?

1413
01:48:41,710 --> 01:48:44,751
Studying all night, sir
Studying?

1414
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:45,960
Really?

1415
01:48:46,043 --> 01:48:49,125
Hasn't slept two nights,
that's why he looks scruffy

1416
01:48:49,126 --> 01:48:50,126
Not slept?

1417
01:48:50,210 --> 01:48:51,210
What did you study?

1418
01:48:52,335 --> 01:48:56,335
Induction motor, sir.
The whole chapter

1419
01:48:56,668 --> 01:48:57,668
Whole chapter?

1420
01:48:57,793 --> 01:48:59,917
In that case, Mr. Raju Rastogi …

1421
01:48:59,918 --> 01:49:00,918
Yessir!

1422
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,585
Can you tell us how an
induction motor starts?

1423
01:49:11,710 --> 01:49:12,710
Stop it

1424
01:49:20,293 --> 01:49:22,543
Sir, rum

1425
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:25,460
Mr. Rastogi

1426
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:28,293
Let's have a cup of tea
in my office

1427
01:49:34,418 --> 01:49:35,418
Sir?

1428
01:49:36,543 --> 01:49:37,543
Close the door

1429
01:49:42,710 --> 01:49:43,751
Can you type?

1430
01:49:45,085 --> 01:49:46,085
Yes, sir

1431
01:49:46,168 --> 01:49:47,585
Will you type a letter for me?

1432
01:49:49,710 --> 01:49:50,751
Definitely, sir

1433
01:49:51,085 --> 01:49:52,085
Come, sit

1434
01:49:52,793 --> 01:49:53,793
Sir, I'm sorry sir …

1435
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:57,210
Please type

1436
01:49:58,835 --> 01:49:59,835
Dear Sir …

1437
01:50:00,626 --> 01:50:04,001
It is my painful duty to inform you …

1438
01:50:05,335 --> 01:50:08,001
that your son is rusticated …

1439
01:50:08,793 --> 01:50:11,335
No, sorry, delete that. Go back

1440
01:50:12,085 --> 01:50:16,126
Your son, Mr. Raju Rastogi …

1441
01:50:17,251 --> 01:50:21,376
is rusticated from the
Imperial College of Engineering

1442
01:50:22,001 --> 01:50:23,376
Come on, type

1443
01:50:30,876 --> 01:50:32,543
It'll kill my dad, sir

1444
01:50:32,751 --> 01:50:34,501
Please type - Sir, please sir

1445
01:50:35,001 --> 01:50:38,918
My decision is final and
irrevocable

1446
01:50:41,001 --> 01:50:46,209
He lives just to see me
become an engineer

1447
01:50:46,210 --> 01:50:50,460
Should've thought of that
before peeing on my door

1448
01:50:50,626 --> 01:50:55,043
Sir, give me one chance … please

1449
01:51:00,668 --> 01:51:04,043
Ok, remove your name
from the letter …

1450
01:51:05,418 --> 01:51:07,543
and put in Rancho's

1451
01:51:09,001 --> 01:51:11,168
I know he was with you
last night

1452
01:51:12,043 --> 01:51:16,085
Be my witness and I'll spare you

1453
01:51:19,668 --> 01:51:23,668
You have 7 ½ minutes to think

1454
01:52:10,793 --> 01:52:15,710
<i>We won't let go of you</i>

1455
01:52:17,210 --> 01:52:22,626
<i>We're not done yet … no way</i>

1456
01:52:24,793 --> 01:52:28,084
<i>The heavens may beckon you</i>

1457
01:52:28,085 --> 01:52:31,334
<i>But we'll take up arms against God</i>

1458
01:52:31,335 --> 01:52:37,376
<i>And it's not a fight we intend to lose</i>

1459
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:41,043
<i>You may try your best to escape</i>

1460
01:52:41,210 --> 01:52:44,376
<i>Try with all your might</i>

1461
01:52:44,585 --> 01:52:51,168
<i>But there is no way
we are letting go of you</i>

1462
01:52:51,793 --> 01:52:57,835
<i>We won't let go of you</i>

1463
01:52:58,335 --> 01:53:04,585
<i>We're not done yet … no way</i>

1464
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:09,168
Rancho, watch that monitor

1465
01:53:09,501 --> 01:53:10,501
Raju

1466
01:53:12,085 --> 01:53:15,210
His body is paralyzed with shock,
but his mind is alert

1467
01:53:15,751 --> 01:53:20,043
He can see and hear us.
Please don't cry in front of him

1468
01:53:21,918 --> 01:53:26,293
Speak to him normally,
motivate him, joke around

1469
01:53:29,335 --> 01:53:31,960
Good news, Raju.
Your dad's recovered

1470
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:33,543
The new medicine worked

1471
01:53:34,001 --> 01:53:36,793
Is this your family tradition -

1472
01:53:37,626 --> 01:53:40,710
As one male gets up,
the other conks out?

1473
01:53:40,918 --> 01:53:42,626
Come, wake up

1474
01:53:43,543 --> 01:53:44,918
Your dad wants Pia's scooter

1475
01:53:45,085 --> 01:53:48,876
Should I give it to him?
Hope he won't dent it

1476
01:53:54,918 --> 01:53:59,210
Raju, Farhan is live on webcam.
From the hostel

1477
01:54:01,501 --> 01:54:04,293
Look, Virus has canceled
your suspension order

1478
01:54:04,668 --> 01:54:06,876
Problem solved … Wake up now

1479
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:09,918
Everything's resolved!
You hear that?

1480
01:54:10,335 --> 01:54:13,126
Rise and shine, buddy

1481
01:54:14,751 --> 01:54:17,918
<i>In this journey of few strides</i>

1482
01:54:18,168 --> 01:54:21,126
<i>On the path called life</i>

1483
01:54:21,335 --> 01:54:27,126
<i>Don't quit …
Just celebrate the ride</i>

1484
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:31,085
<i>Listen please to those
who love you</i>

1485
01:54:31,251 --> 01:54:34,251
<i>Every dark night is
followed by sunrise</i>

1486
01:54:34,626 --> 01:54:39,835
<i>Don't shut out those
who love you</i>

1487
01:54:40,085 --> 01:54:46,543
<i>We won't let go of you</i>

1488
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:53,001
<i>We're not done yet … no way</i>

1489
01:54:53,251 --> 01:54:59,626
<i>We won't let go of you</i>

1490
01:54:59,793 --> 01:55:07,335
<i>We're not done yet … no way</i>

1491
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:14,543
Look, mom bought a new saree
Brand new

1492
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:16,293
It cost 2000/-

1493
01:55:17,001 --> 01:55:18,210
Wake up now

1494
01:55:19,418 --> 01:55:21,501
She bought not one,
but ten sarees

1495
01:55:22,001 --> 01:55:23,001
Look!

1496
01:55:25,001 --> 01:55:26,167
Hey Raju!

1497
01:55:26,168 --> 01:55:29,168
C'mon tell me … How do I look?

1498
01:55:30,293 --> 01:55:33,335
<i>Remember the letters
mom would write …</i>

1499
01:55:33,501 --> 01:55:36,585
<i>Always blessed you
with eternal life</i>

1500
01:55:36,793 --> 01:55:42,876
<i>Don't die on her … you can't die</i>

1501
01:55:43,293 --> 01:55:46,460
<i>Look at us now, don't turn away</i>

1502
01:55:46,626 --> 01:55:49,710
<i>Smile once to show you care</i>

1503
01:55:49,918 --> 01:55:54,335
<i>Wake up,
don't torment us anymore</i>

1504
01:56:03,251 --> 01:56:06,668
Did you hear about your sis?

1505
01:56:07,626 --> 01:56:10,293
She's getting married

1506
01:56:11,335 --> 01:56:12,626
Without any dowry

1507
01:56:13,335 --> 01:56:18,210
The bridegroom wants
nothing at all

1508
01:56:18,460 --> 01:56:21,918
He just wants Kammo

1509
01:56:22,585 --> 01:56:26,792
You know who the bridegroom is?
Yeah

1510
01:56:26,793 --> 01:56:27,710
Guess!

1511
01:56:27,711 --> 01:56:29,585
You know him very well - Yes

1512
01:56:29,793 --> 01:56:31,418
He loves animals - Huh …?

1513
01:56:32,251 --> 01:56:34,375
He's going to be a
wildlife photographer

1514
01:56:34,376 --> 01:56:36,042
Quiet … Shhhh …

1515
01:56:36,043 --> 01:56:39,168
Didn't get it? It's our Farhan

1516
01:56:40,168 --> 01:56:44,251
Farhan will never take any dowry

1517
01:56:44,918 --> 01:56:49,251
Farhan will marry your sister

1518
01:56:49,710 --> 01:56:53,835
For free! Free! Free!

1519
01:56:54,918 --> 01:56:57,001
Raju!

1520
01:57:04,001 --> 01:57:07,751
One kilo okra, 500 grams cheese
for 'free' would've woken him

1521
01:57:08,168 --> 01:57:09,876
Why sacrifice me …!

1522
01:57:10,168 --> 01:57:12,126
Well done, buddy

1523
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:16,460
So it's all fixed -
Farhan will marry your sister

1524
01:57:17,585 --> 01:57:18,585
Rancho

1525
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:24,335
Rascals … Stop fibbing

1526
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:27,960
Lucky escape!

1527
01:57:28,168 --> 01:57:34,543
<i>We won't let go of you</i>

1528
01:57:34,710 --> 01:57:41,126
<i>We're not done yet … no way</i>

1529
01:57:41,335 --> 01:57:47,668
<i>We won't let go of you</i>

1530
01:57:47,876 --> 01:57:53,917
<i>We're not done yet … no way</i>

1531
01:57:53,918 --> 01:58:00,376
<i>We won't let go of you</i>

1532
01:58:00,543 --> 01:58:08,543
'Okra Rs.12 / kilo'

1533
01:58:11,793 --> 01:58:13,417
You called for a taxi?

1534
01:58:13,418 --> 01:58:15,168
I did - It's waiting

1535
01:58:15,335 --> 01:58:16,793
Thank you. Why?

1536
01:58:17,251 --> 01:58:18,543
I'm going to the job interview

1537
01:58:18,835 --> 01:58:20,043
You coming with me?

1538
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:25,043
No. I'm going for the interview.
You're going home

1539
01:58:25,210 --> 01:58:26,543
Why would I go home?

1540
01:58:28,085 --> 01:58:31,501
Remember, we promised
this rascal

1541
01:58:34,876 --> 01:58:36,918
Give me your tie

1542
01:58:38,501 --> 01:58:39,501
Why?

1543
01:58:39,585 --> 01:58:43,460
I doubt you'll go for the
interview after reading this

1544
01:58:44,418 --> 01:58:45,418
What's that?

1545
01:58:45,501 --> 01:58:48,335
A letter - For you, from Hungary

1546
01:58:48,710 --> 01:58:51,293
Some photographer
called Andre Istvan

1547
01:58:59,251 --> 01:59:01,001
You posted my letter!

1548
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:02,876
He loved your pictures

1549
01:59:03,376 --> 01:59:06,001
The guy wants you to assist him …

1550
01:59:06,835 --> 01:59:10,335
in the Brazilian rain forest,
for a year

1551
01:59:10,751 --> 01:59:12,293
Will pay you, too

1552
01:59:28,251 --> 01:59:29,501
Dad will never agree

1553
01:59:32,126 --> 01:59:34,751
Go speak to him …
from your heart

1554
01:59:36,460 --> 01:59:37,585
For once, dump your fears …

1555
01:59:38,293 --> 01:59:44,293
or someday, on your deathbed,
you'll regret it

1556
01:59:44,835 --> 01:59:47,515
You'll remember that the letter was
in your hand, taxi at the gate …

1557
01:59:47,543 --> 01:59:51,293
With just a little courage, you
could've turned your life around

1558
01:59:57,876 --> 01:59:59,793
Do you think he'll like it?

1559
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:02,751
Why such an expensive gift?

1560
02:00:03,918 --> 02:00:06,335
Our son's getting
his first job today

1561
02:00:07,668 --> 02:00:11,543
Don't be stingy at
such a proud moment

1562
02:00:13,501 --> 02:00:14,501
Farhan?

1563
02:00:19,585 --> 02:00:21,835
Don't you have
the job interview today?

1564
02:00:23,668 --> 02:00:24,668
I didn't go

1565
02:00:27,293 --> 02:00:29,001
I don't want to be
an engineer, Dad

1566
02:00:33,251 --> 02:00:35,168
What happened?
You had an accident?

1567
02:00:38,835 --> 02:00:44,043
See that building?
I jumped from its third floor

1568
02:00:46,876 --> 02:00:47,876
Why?

1569
02:00:48,126 --> 02:00:50,418
Because I was rusticated
from college

1570
02:00:53,376 --> 02:00:54,376
Why?

1571
02:00:54,710 --> 02:00:59,501
Drunk, I urinated
on the Director's door

1572
02:01:01,835 --> 02:01:05,460
That scoundrel Rancho
is messing with your mind!

1573
02:01:05,626 --> 02:01:09,335
I don't enjoy Engineering.
I'd make a terrible engineer

1574
02:01:11,501 --> 02:01:16,085
Rancho has a simple belief -
Make your passion your profession

1575
02:01:16,460 --> 02:01:18,001
Then work will become play

1576
02:01:18,168 --> 02:01:20,043
What'll you earn in that jungle?

1577
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:24,417
A small stipend, but I'll learn a lot

1578
02:01:24,418 --> 02:01:25,585
Five years from now …

1579
02:01:26,335 --> 02:01:31,167
when you see your friends buying
cars and homes, you'll curse yourself

1580
02:01:31,168 --> 02:01:35,126
Life as an engineer will bring
only frustration. Then I'll curse you

1581
02:01:37,210 --> 02:01:38,960
I'd rather curse myself, Dad

1582
02:01:39,126 --> 02:01:40,293
The world will laugh!

1583
02:01:41,585 --> 02:01:43,543
Label you a loser,
for quitting in the final year

1584
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:50,126
Mr. Kapoor feels you're fortunate
to be at ICE. What'll he think?

1585
02:01:50,418 --> 02:01:52,543
Mr. Kapoor didn't provide me
with an air-conditioner

1586
02:01:55,376 --> 02:01:57,856
It wasn't Mr. Kapoor who slept
in discomfort while I slept well

1587
02:02:00,001 --> 02:02:02,960
He didn't take me around the zoo
on his shoulders

1588
02:02:05,835 --> 02:02:07,043
You did all that, Dad

1589
02:02:09,543 --> 02:02:14,960
How you feel, matters to me.
Mr. Kapoor makes no difference

1590
02:02:16,168 --> 02:02:18,001
I don't even know his first name

1591
02:02:18,168 --> 02:02:21,043
You think you're the hero
of a melodrama?

1592
02:02:21,251 --> 02:02:23,960
Enough, please … he's upset

1593
02:02:25,251 --> 02:02:27,668
God forbid, if he did
something crazy like Raju …

1594
02:02:27,918 --> 02:02:29,460
Then the discussion is over

1595
02:02:29,793 --> 02:02:33,543
Don't say a word or
His Lordship will jump off the roof

1596
02:02:37,043 --> 02:02:42,001
No, Dad. I'll never attempt suicide.
I promise

1597
02:02:44,543 --> 02:02:51,501
The Rancho you detest
put this picture in my wallet

1598
02:02:53,126 --> 02:02:56,918
Told me to see it if a suicidal thought
crossed my mind

1599
02:02:57,085 --> 02:03:00,417
and imagine what'd happen
to your smiles

1600
02:03:00,418 --> 02:03:02,168
when you see my dead body

1601
02:03:07,501 --> 02:03:11,501
I want to convince you, Dad

1602
02:03:13,001 --> 02:03:15,418
but not with a suicide threat

1603
02:03:19,210 --> 02:03:23,001
Dad, what'll happen
if I become a photographer?

1604
02:03:23,335 --> 02:03:24,543
I'll earn less

1605
02:03:25,501 --> 02:03:27,168
I'll have a smaller house,
a smaller car

1606
02:03:29,251 --> 02:03:30,751
But I'll be happy

1607
02:03:32,460 --> 02:03:33,710
I will be really happy

1608
02:03:35,043 --> 02:03:36,963
Whatever I do for you
will be out of genuine love

1609
02:03:38,626 --> 02:03:40,335
I've always listened to you

1610
02:03:40,751 --> 02:03:43,835
For once,
let me listen to my heart

1611
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:46,960
Please … Dad

1612
02:03:53,293 --> 02:03:54,293
Dad …

1613
02:03:55,460 --> 02:03:56,668
Please don't go away …

1614
02:04:02,918 --> 02:04:04,085
Return this

1615
02:04:07,626 --> 02:04:10,043
Son, what's the cost
of a professional camera?

1616
02:04:11,335 --> 02:04:13,085
Can the laptop be exchanged for it?

1617
02:04:14,585 --> 02:04:16,418
If you need more money, just ask

1618
02:04:25,251 --> 02:04:27,168
Go live your life, my son

1619
02:04:30,126 --> 02:04:34,376
Your grades are consistently poor.
Reason?

1620
02:04:35,085 --> 02:04:36,085
Fear

1621
02:04:37,043 --> 02:04:38,443
I was a good student
since childhood

1622
02:04:39,210 --> 02:04:41,335
Parents hoped
I'd end their poverty

1623
02:04:43,293 --> 02:04:44,293
That scared me

1624
02:04:45,793 --> 02:04:49,251
Here I saw the mad race.
You don't count if you're not first

1625
02:04:51,001 --> 02:04:52,001
My fear grew

1626
02:04:53,710 --> 02:04:55,126
Fear is not good for grades, sir

1627
02:04:55,793 --> 02:04:58,168
I slipped on more
charms and rings

1628
02:04:59,210 --> 02:05:03,626
Prayed to God for favors.
No … begged for favors

1629
02:05:06,751 --> 02:05:09,835
16 broken bones gave me
two months to think and reflect

1630
02:05:10,418 --> 02:05:11,626
Finally, sense dawned

1631
02:05:13,168 --> 02:05:18,293
Today I didn't beg God for this job,
just thanked him for this life

1632
02:05:20,793 --> 02:05:24,751
If you reject me, no regrets

1633
02:05:25,126 --> 02:05:29,210
I'll still do something
worthwhile with my life

1634
02:05:29,793 --> 02:05:34,960
Such frank behavior
is not good for our firm

1635
02:05:35,585 --> 02:05:39,959
We need someone diplomatic
to handle clients

1636
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:42,293
You're too straightforward

1637
02:05:44,210 --> 02:05:45,210
But …

1638
02:05:46,210 --> 02:05:52,626
if you assure us
you'll control this attitude

1639
02:05:52,793 --> 02:05:55,751
we may consider you

1640
02:05:59,126 --> 02:06:02,251
It took two broken legs
to get me up on my feet

1641
02:06:04,168 --> 02:06:05,960
Wasn't easy to get this attitude

1642
02:06:06,710 --> 02:06:07,710
Can't change it, sir

1643
02:06:11,251 --> 02:06:16,460
You keep your job …
I'll keep my attitude

1644
02:06:16,626 --> 02:06:17,960
I'm sorry, no offense, sir

1645
02:06:22,376 --> 02:06:23,376
Wait

1646
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:29,168
I've interviewed countless
candidates for 25 years

1647
02:06:29,626 --> 02:06:32,460
Everyone turns into
a yes-man to get the job

1648
02:06:32,668 --> 02:06:34,001
Where did you spring from, son?

1649
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:36,960
Sir?

1650
02:06:37,043 --> 02:06:39,626
Shall we discuss the salary?

1651
02:06:47,210 --> 02:06:48,210
Thank you, sir

1652
02:07:20,668 --> 02:07:24,835
Your Majesty, thou art great

1653
02:07:26,793 --> 02:07:28,418
Accept this humble offering

1654
02:08:05,043 --> 02:08:08,460
Govind!

1655
02:08:10,543 --> 02:08:14,001
You had said, 'If he gets a job,
shave it off'

1656
02:08:21,251 --> 02:08:22,251
What have you done?

1657
02:08:25,876 --> 02:08:29,251
I feel naked without
my moustache

1658
02:08:31,585 --> 02:08:33,460
I've lost my dignity

1659
02:08:35,585 --> 02:08:38,001
I won't accept defeat, Rastogi

1660
02:08:39,335 --> 02:08:43,335
The job isn't yours until you
pass your final exam

1661
02:08:44,835 --> 02:08:48,751
And this time,
I will set the question paper

1662
02:08:52,001 --> 02:08:54,543
Dad, that's not fair

1663
02:08:56,918 --> 02:09:00,418
Everything is fair in
Love and War

1664
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:04,251
And this is World War … III

1665
02:09:05,751 --> 02:09:06,791
Rastogi, you're dead meat!

1666
02:09:11,751 --> 02:09:12,751
Hey

1667
02:09:15,085 --> 02:09:16,085
What're you doing here?

1668
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:19,960
Be careful

1669
02:09:25,501 --> 02:09:29,335
You've been drinking
Yup, had to down a couple

1670
02:09:29,918 --> 02:09:32,209
A couple too many!

1671
02:09:32,210 --> 02:09:34,085
Needed the guts - For what?

1672
02:09:35,876 --> 02:09:37,376
For stealing this - What's this?

1673
02:09:38,501 --> 02:09:42,626
The duplicate key to
Virus's office

1674
02:09:45,168 --> 02:09:47,460
The question paper's
in a cover with a red seal

1675
02:09:48,168 --> 02:09:52,126
Dad has set it, to fail Raju

1676
02:09:52,460 --> 02:09:53,460
Go get it!

1677
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:57,001
Are you mad or what -
that's cheating!

1678
02:10:01,501 --> 02:10:04,710
Everything's fair in
Love and War

1679
02:10:06,251 --> 02:10:07,251
Tell me something …

1680
02:10:09,210 --> 02:10:10,376
Do you really feel …

1681
02:10:11,960 --> 02:10:17,460
the noses collide while kissing?

1682
02:10:22,918 --> 02:10:26,626
Wait. Have some dhokla

1683
02:10:29,126 --> 02:10:31,710
You Gujaratis are so cute

1684
02:10:32,668 --> 02:10:35,960
But why does your food
sound so dangerous?

1685
02:10:37,085 --> 02:10:42,293
Dhokla, Fafda, Handwa,
Thepla, Khakhra

1686
02:10:43,460 --> 02:10:45,625
Sound like missiles

1687
02:10:45,626 --> 02:10:46,626
C'mon

1688
02:10:46,710 --> 02:10:49,168
'Today Bush dropped
two Dhoklas on Iraq'

1689
02:10:49,835 --> 02:10:52,668
'400 dead, 200 injured'

1690
02:10:53,043 --> 02:10:54,043
C'mon

1691
02:10:57,418 --> 02:10:58,418
Oh …

1692
02:10:59,918 --> 02:11:04,335
I can deal with Khakhra, Fafda.
But your name …

1693
02:11:05,293 --> 02:11:08,585
'Ranchhoddas Shamaldas
Chanchad' - Yuck

1694
02:11:09,835 --> 02:11:12,376
I won't change my last name
after marriage

1695
02:11:14,251 --> 02:11:17,210
Pia, we can't get married

1696
02:11:20,793 --> 02:11:21,793
Why?

1697
02:11:22,543 --> 02:11:23,960
Is there someone else?

1698
02:11:26,501 --> 02:11:27,501
No

1699
02:11:27,668 --> 02:11:29,376
- Are you gay?
- No

1700
02:11:31,251 --> 02:11:33,126
Then why don't you
propose to me?

1701
02:11:37,710 --> 02:11:39,126
- Are you impotent?
- No

1702
02:11:41,835 --> 02:11:43,626
Then prove it

1703
02:11:44,126 --> 02:11:45,126
Pia, no

1704
02:11:45,335 --> 02:11:46,751
Stop, stop!

1705
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:49,293
What happened?
We didn't inform Pia

1706
02:11:49,793 --> 02:11:51,917
Stop here,
my bladders are bursting

1707
02:11:51,918 --> 02:11:53,751
Shut up!
Are you in touch with her?

1708
02:11:54,085 --> 02:11:57,210
No … I have her home number
Then call her, I'll stop

1709
02:12:03,710 --> 02:12:04,626
Hello

1710
02:12:04,627 --> 02:12:06,917
No place for urine-expulsion
in this country

1711
02:12:06,918 --> 02:12:10,293
Hello, is Pia there?
No, she's not

1712
02:12:10,710 --> 02:12:12,460
Is she at the hospital?

1713
02:12:12,626 --> 02:12:14,168
Why would she be there?

1714
02:12:14,418 --> 02:12:16,585
She's getting married today
in Manali

1715
02:12:24,626 --> 02:12:25,835
Too late! She's married

1716
02:12:27,293 --> 02:12:30,168
Not yet. It's a six hour drive

1717
02:12:30,543 --> 02:12:32,585
If we rush, we'll reach
before the vows

1718
02:12:33,126 --> 02:12:34,126
What do you say?

1719
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:38,335
It's a no-brainer. Let's turn back

1720
02:12:38,585 --> 02:12:40,293
No turning back

1721
02:12:40,793 --> 02:12:43,501
Straight to Ladakh.
We'll meet Rancho and return

1722
02:12:43,710 --> 02:12:46,251
I have a Friday meeting with
Phunsukh Wangdu

1723
02:12:46,418 --> 02:12:47,918
Get into the car

1724
02:12:48,210 --> 02:12:51,335
If I miss my meeting,
the Japanese will get him

1725
02:12:51,751 --> 02:12:54,126
They're offering him a
first name in the company

1726
02:12:54,293 --> 02:12:57,251
'Phunsukh and Fujiyashi',
profit sharing …

1727
02:13:30,501 --> 02:13:32,626
Pia weds Suhas!
Thanks for the suit

1728
02:13:35,001 --> 02:13:36,460
Virus will have a heart attack

1729
02:13:37,585 --> 02:13:40,251
At every daughter's wedding,
we're there to rock the party

1730
02:13:41,710 --> 02:13:45,085
Listen, I'll update Pia,
you peel off the price tag

1731
02:14:01,918 --> 02:14:04,126
Farhan - We found Rancho

1732
02:14:12,293 --> 02:14:13,876
- For Room 107?
- Yes, sir

1733
02:14:14,626 --> 02:14:17,418
- You've taken ages.
- Sorry, sir

1734
02:14:17,585 --> 02:14:18,585
Off, now

1735
02:14:27,501 --> 02:14:29,168
Housekeeping, sir - Come in

1736
02:14:29,751 --> 02:14:32,459
<i>Amore … Amore …</i>

1737
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:33,917
Quick, iron my coat

1738
02:14:33,918 --> 02:14:36,751
<i>Amore … Amore …</i>

1739
02:14:37,626 --> 02:14:40,835
We found Rancho!
Now you can't marry this ass

1740
02:14:41,376 --> 02:14:42,418
You're mad, Farhan

1741
02:14:43,585 --> 02:14:46,210
Don't fool yourself, Pia.
You still love Rancho

1742
02:14:46,460 --> 02:14:48,376
You're still eating his favorite food

1743
02:14:48,710 --> 02:14:51,335
<i>Amore … Amore …</i>

1744
02:15:06,751 --> 02:15:11,042
He's incorrigible.
Once a price tag, always a price tag

1745
02:15:11,043 --> 02:15:13,876
Shut up, Farhan.
Suhas is a changed man

1746
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:16,500
He doesn't speak of
brands and prices anymore

1747
02:15:16,501 --> 02:15:19,792
My 150,000/ - coat

1748
02:15:19,793 --> 02:15:21,959
Why do you people eat sauce?

1749
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:24,542
I'll sort it out, sir - How?

1750
02:15:24,543 --> 02:15:27,085
Our laundry specializes in
cleaning mint-stained suits

1751
02:15:27,251 --> 02:15:29,210
I'll clean it in a jiffy

1752
02:15:34,543 --> 02:15:35,835
Get it soon

1753
02:15:36,835 --> 02:15:39,043
But it's too late now, Farhan
Pia

1754
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:42,168
Let's go, Pia, we're late

1755
02:15:53,626 --> 02:15:56,960
Pia, it's me … Raju.
Don't yell, they'll kill me

1756
02:16:02,126 --> 02:16:03,085
Where is Suhas?

1757
02:16:03,086 --> 02:16:05,793
Housekeeping took my coat

1758
02:16:06,293 --> 02:16:08,043
Go … Send Suhas here

1759
02:16:08,293 --> 02:16:11,460
It's rude to leave the ceremony

1760
02:16:22,793 --> 02:16:24,418
- Yeah, Farhan?
- The car's ready

1761
02:16:24,793 --> 02:16:27,376
Grab her hand and run.
Don't move

1762
02:16:28,918 --> 02:16:30,584
Sir … - My coat?

1763
02:16:30,585 --> 02:16:31,710
You're here …

1764
02:16:31,918 --> 02:16:33,501
- So who's at the altar?
- Altar?

1765
02:16:35,835 --> 02:16:38,293
Another couple of rounds,
and we'll be considered married

1766
02:16:38,501 --> 02:16:40,751
I'm already married, Pia.
Let's go

1767
02:16:41,251 --> 02:16:44,501
It's too late.
People will laugh at me

1768
02:16:44,793 --> 02:16:46,543
So you'll commit suicide?

1769
02:16:47,168 --> 02:16:48,168
Rastogi!

1770
02:16:48,169 --> 02:16:50,251
People will gossip briefly,
then forget

1771
02:16:51,668 --> 02:16:54,750
But you … you'll regret
on your deathbed

1772
02:16:54,751 --> 02:16:57,501
that the car was at the gate,
Rancho within reach …

1773
02:16:57,876 --> 02:17:01,335
but in fear of people,
you married this ass

1774
02:17:03,543 --> 02:17:04,543
Housekeeping?

1775
02:17:44,210 --> 02:17:47,210
Pia, minor problem

1776
02:17:47,543 --> 02:17:48,543
What?

1777
02:17:48,835 --> 02:17:50,542
We don't know if Rancho's married

1778
02:17:50,543 --> 02:17:51,460
What!

1779
02:17:51,461 --> 02:17:54,085
He won't be married
And if he is?

1780
02:17:55,001 --> 02:17:56,376
Then we'll drop you back

1781
02:17:57,293 --> 02:18:01,043
Relax! Handmade biscuit?

1782
02:18:04,918 --> 02:18:05,918
What's he doing here?

1783
02:18:06,835 --> 02:18:10,210
Ignore him
The biscuit's very good

1784
02:18:11,293 --> 02:18:13,126
<i>Till yesterday,
I was a law-abiding citizen</i>

1785
02:18:13,668 --> 02:18:17,501
<i>But in the last 24 hours,
I'd grounded an aircraft</i>

1786
02:18:18,335 --> 02:18:20,751
<i>almost assigned Shamaldas's
ashes to the sewers, and</i>

1787
02:18:21,043 --> 02:18:25,418
<i>made a bride elope from her
own wedding! All for Rancho</i>

1788
02:18:26,918 --> 02:18:29,001
<i>But he too would do
anything for friends</i>

1789
02:18:29,293 --> 02:18:32,875
<i>Like stealing the question paper …
from the lion's den</i>

1790
02:18:32,876 --> 02:18:33,916
Envelope with the red seal

1791
02:18:34,918 --> 02:18:39,876
<i>He feared that if Raju failed,
there'd be another high jump</i>

1792
02:18:43,085 --> 02:18:48,335
<i>We were principled thieves,
stealing the paper only for Raju</i>

1793
02:18:48,751 --> 02:18:50,151
<i>We'd sworn we won't even
take a peek</i>

1794
02:18:52,585 --> 02:18:53,876
Where's it hidden …

1795
02:18:54,085 --> 02:18:57,668
We'll grow old searching!
Ask Pia

1796
02:19:03,918 --> 02:19:05,043
Pia, your phone

1797
02:19:06,335 --> 02:19:09,667
Mr. Papa-To-Be!
If you say 'All is well', he kicks

1798
02:19:09,668 --> 02:19:10,668
He kicked

1799
02:19:12,960 --> 02:19:14,418
Pia, your phone

1800
02:19:20,293 --> 02:19:21,501
Found it! Rancho

1801
02:19:23,001 --> 02:19:24,001
Hello?

1802
02:19:42,418 --> 02:19:44,626
Quick, photocopy this

1803
02:20:05,751 --> 02:20:06,751
Where was it?

1804
02:20:06,918 --> 02:20:07,918
Put it back

1805
02:20:31,251 --> 02:20:33,251
- We're safe!
- Where were you?

1806
02:20:37,876 --> 02:20:39,543
Here - What's this?

1807
02:20:39,918 --> 02:20:40,918
A gift

1808
02:20:41,960 --> 02:20:45,835
Question paper.
Virus set it himself, to fail you

1809
02:20:53,460 --> 02:20:54,751
Strange buddies!

1810
02:20:56,126 --> 02:21:00,668
First teach you to be upright,
then offer a path to shame

1811
02:21:02,751 --> 02:21:03,751
No way

1812
02:21:05,376 --> 02:21:06,736
If I pass,
it'll be on my own steam

1813
02:21:10,626 --> 02:21:11,751
If I don't, it's still ok

1814
02:21:29,001 --> 02:21:33,501
<i>He'd won us over!
I felt like embracing him as family …</i>

1815
02:21:34,460 --> 02:21:36,335
<i>but then I controlled my emotions</i>

1816
02:21:55,460 --> 02:21:58,418
Damn thief - Sir, please, sir

1817
02:21:58,585 --> 02:22:01,751
Rascal - Sorry sir

1818
02:22:02,335 --> 02:22:03,585
Wanted to change the system

1819
02:22:05,335 --> 02:22:10,251
You'll pee on my door
Sir, what're you doing

1820
02:22:11,793 --> 02:22:12,793
Sorry sir

1821
02:22:14,251 --> 02:22:16,085
You are rusticated!

1822
02:22:16,918 --> 02:22:19,876
If all of you aren't out by morning,
I'll call the police

1823
02:22:20,335 --> 02:22:21,626
I will call the police!

1824
02:22:24,168 --> 02:22:25,168
Rascals!

1825
02:22:25,335 --> 02:22:26,626
Rascals, all of you

1826
02:22:30,668 --> 02:22:32,960
How did he get my office key?

1827
02:22:34,293 --> 02:22:35,668
I gave him the key, Dad

1828
02:22:37,085 --> 02:22:40,668
I wish I'd given this key to
my brother … He'd be alive today

1829
02:22:40,876 --> 02:22:41,876
Stop it, Pia

1830
02:22:42,918 --> 02:22:45,710
You think your son
fell off a train and died?

1831
02:22:46,293 --> 02:22:47,293
Shut up, Pia

1832
02:22:47,294 --> 02:22:49,543
You decided he'd be an engineer

1833
02:22:49,751 --> 02:22:52,001
Did you ever ask him
what he wanted to be?

1834
02:22:52,835 --> 02:22:54,376
You put such pressure on him …

1835
02:22:54,793 --> 02:22:57,043
that he chose death
over the entrance exam

1836
02:23:01,335 --> 02:23:02,335
I don't understand …

1837
02:23:03,001 --> 02:23:05,543
Dad, you go to your room

1838
02:23:09,460 --> 02:23:11,793
Pia, don't do this

1839
02:23:14,293 --> 02:23:18,168
He wanted to study Literature,
be a writer

1840
02:23:20,460 --> 02:23:23,000
But all he wrote was
this suicide note

1841
02:23:23,001 --> 02:23:24,251
Put that away, please

1842
02:23:24,460 --> 02:23:26,085
No more cover-ups!

1843
02:23:29,501 --> 02:23:32,792
Just once …

1844
02:23:32,793 --> 02:23:36,460
if you'd said - Don't do Engineering
if you don't want to

1845
02:23:37,335 --> 02:23:38,710
just do what your heart is in

1846
02:23:40,210 --> 02:23:41,918
then he'd be alive today

1847
02:23:49,876 --> 02:23:51,918
He didn't commit suicide

1848
02:23:52,668 --> 02:23:53,668
You're right, Dad

1849
02:23:55,210 --> 02:23:56,418
It wasn't suicide …

1850
02:23:58,918 --> 02:23:59,960
It was murder

1851
02:24:15,918 --> 02:24:18,834
<i>Many city roads are
completely submerged</i>

1852
02:24:18,835 --> 02:24:20,793
<i>Traffic has come to a standstill</i>

1853
02:24:34,751 --> 02:24:38,543
Dad …

1854
02:24:39,668 --> 02:24:40,668
Mona?

1855
02:24:44,793 --> 02:24:47,251
Go back, Millimeter.
Why're you following us?

1856
02:24:47,835 --> 02:24:50,085
Why? Your pop owns the road?

1857
02:24:50,251 --> 02:24:51,918
Please help,
we are desperate here!

1858
02:24:52,918 --> 02:24:54,751
You can't send an ambulance?

1859
02:24:55,793 --> 02:24:57,668
Get it from another hospital

1860
02:24:58,335 --> 02:25:01,835
The entire city's flooded, sir.
We're helpless

1861
02:25:05,376 --> 02:25:06,626
Mona, you ok?

1862
02:25:07,210 --> 02:25:08,210
Rancho, Pia

1863
02:25:10,585 --> 02:25:14,418
Rancho, you can't reach here.
Do as I say

1864
02:25:14,751 --> 02:25:19,585
The water bag has burst

1865
02:25:20,626 --> 02:25:23,126
Disconnected! Mona

1866
02:25:28,376 --> 02:25:29,376
Mona!

1867
02:25:33,751 --> 02:25:35,251
Turn on the lights - Where to?

1868
02:25:35,793 --> 02:25:39,710
To the table tennis table
Pia, we're in the common room

1869
02:25:43,710 --> 02:25:45,543
Raju, turn on the web camera

1870
02:25:51,710 --> 02:25:52,835
Where's Mona? Show me

1871
02:25:54,418 --> 02:25:55,418
Hold on

1872
02:25:57,585 --> 02:25:58,585
Here, Pia

1873
02:25:58,751 --> 02:26:01,750
Mona, don't worry. I'm with you

1874
02:26:01,751 --> 02:26:02,751
Pia, I'm dying!

1875
02:26:03,126 --> 02:26:05,710
Rancho, even when
there were no hospitals or docs

1876
02:26:05,876 --> 02:26:07,251
babies were delivered

1877
02:26:07,876 --> 02:26:10,168
You all will deliver this baby

1878
02:26:12,876 --> 02:26:14,418
All is well

1879
02:26:14,585 --> 02:26:17,543
How dare you? I'll kill you

1880
02:26:17,710 --> 02:26:19,710
Dad, stay out of this

1881
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:22,917
Farhan, get towels and scissors

1882
02:26:22,918 --> 02:26:25,376
Millimeter, get clothes clips
and hot water

1883
02:26:25,668 --> 02:26:27,126
Rancho, cover Mona

1884
02:26:34,710 --> 02:26:36,210
Mona, try pushing

1885
02:26:36,668 --> 02:26:40,585
Push with all your might

1886
02:26:40,876 --> 02:26:43,251
Stop it! I can't do it

1887
02:26:43,501 --> 02:26:45,293
Rancho, check if there's crowning

1888
02:26:46,251 --> 02:26:47,251
Crowning …?

1889
02:26:48,460 --> 02:26:49,460
Get that diagram

1890
02:26:52,293 --> 02:26:55,001
See if the head is coming out

1891
02:26:57,376 --> 02:26:58,668
Check quickly

1892
02:26:59,501 --> 02:27:00,501
Go!

1893
02:27:01,085 --> 02:27:03,543
Go, Rancho, go

1894
02:27:10,835 --> 02:27:13,042
No crowning

1895
02:27:13,043 --> 02:27:14,876
Mona, please push

1896
02:27:17,585 --> 02:27:18,585
Mona!

1897
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:22,585
She's tired, Pia

1898
02:27:23,043 --> 02:27:26,710
Wake her! If she won't push,
it's a big problem

1899
02:27:27,085 --> 02:27:30,835
They need a vacuum cup
Where will they get one?

1900
02:27:31,043 --> 02:27:33,876
What's a vacuum cup?
How is it used?

1901
02:27:34,168 --> 02:27:35,168
I'll show you

1902
02:27:38,293 --> 02:27:42,585
If the mother's too fatigued to push,
a cup is placed on baby's head

1903
02:27:42,918 --> 02:27:46,668
Suction makes the cup
stick to the head …

1904
02:27:47,418 --> 02:27:49,251
and the baby is pulled out

1905
02:27:49,751 --> 02:27:51,918
I can make this - How?

1906
02:27:52,210 --> 02:27:54,084
With a vacuum cleaner
Vacuum cleaner?

1907
02:27:54,085 --> 02:27:55,209
Yes

1908
02:27:55,210 --> 02:27:57,625
That pressure's too high

1909
02:27:57,626 --> 02:27:59,834
I'll control it
D'you have a vacuum cleaner?

1910
02:27:59,835 --> 02:28:00,876
Yes, in my office

1911
02:28:01,335 --> 02:28:04,043
Farhan, rush and get it
Here's the key

1912
02:28:10,043 --> 02:28:13,460
Mona, push

1913
02:28:14,251 --> 02:28:15,751
Oh my God

1914
02:28:16,668 --> 02:28:17,668
What happened?

1915
02:28:22,460 --> 02:28:24,710
Raju, what happened?
The power's gone

1916
02:28:25,710 --> 02:28:27,209
How'll the vacuum work now?

1917
02:28:27,210 --> 02:28:29,834
Farhan, you get the vacuum,
I'll get the power.

1918
02:28:29,835 --> 02:28:30,835
How?

1919
02:28:31,501 --> 02:28:32,960
Millimeter, get Virus out

1920
02:28:34,376 --> 02:28:37,001
What nonsense is this!

1921
02:28:37,251 --> 02:28:40,793
Not this Virus.
My Virus, the inverter

1922
02:28:41,001 --> 02:28:42,876
Get that, quick - Ok

1923
02:28:43,168 --> 02:28:45,293
Raju, wake up the hostel

1924
02:28:45,501 --> 02:28:48,418
Get car batteries, wires,
and a vacuum gauge

1925
02:28:51,293 --> 02:28:53,918
Emergency in the common room!

1926
02:29:24,751 --> 02:29:26,835
- Where's Rancho?
- Here, sir

1927
02:29:27,126 --> 02:29:29,793
Keep the batteries here
… and the wires

1928
02:29:32,085 --> 02:29:35,251
Raju, switch off everything,
connect the inverter to the mains

1929
02:29:40,085 --> 02:29:41,251
Rancho, vacuum cleaner

1930
02:29:42,418 --> 02:29:45,375
Farhan, get your lens cleaner

1931
02:29:45,376 --> 02:29:46,793
- Blower?
- Yeah, get it

1932
02:29:49,543 --> 02:29:50,543
Rancho, blower

1933
02:29:50,710 --> 02:29:52,710
Good. Fix this to the gauge

1934
02:30:19,126 --> 02:30:20,376
Rancho, I'm done

1935
02:30:22,835 --> 02:30:23,960
- All switches off?
- Yes

1936
02:30:25,543 --> 02:30:27,209
Hit the table
and computer switches

1937
02:30:27,210 --> 02:30:28,210
Ok

1938
02:30:40,751 --> 02:30:41,835
Raju, turn on the computer

1939
02:30:42,251 --> 02:30:43,918
Farhan, here

1940
02:30:46,043 --> 02:30:48,043
Pia, come here quick

1941
02:30:50,543 --> 02:30:51,626
Love you, Rancho

1942
02:30:52,418 --> 02:30:54,376
Farhan, turn it on - Ok

1943
02:31:00,960 --> 02:31:02,960
Pia, how much suction?

1944
02:31:03,376 --> 02:31:04,793
Not more than 0.5

1945
02:31:05,043 --> 02:31:07,043
Farhan, 0.5 - Cover it

1946
02:31:08,626 --> 02:31:09,626
0.5

1947
02:31:12,085 --> 02:31:16,085
Vacuum cleaner baby!
Mother of all deliveries

1948
02:31:17,210 --> 02:31:18,085
Farhan, stop

1949
02:31:18,085 --> 02:31:19,085
Ok

1950
02:31:25,335 --> 02:31:26,626
Raju, get on the table

1951
02:31:26,918 --> 02:31:30,043
Push the baby down, like this

1952
02:31:30,251 --> 02:31:31,251
Ok

1953
02:31:32,293 --> 02:31:33,293
Farhan, turn it on

1954
02:31:37,793 --> 02:31:40,085
C'mon, you can do it

1955
02:31:41,251 --> 02:31:43,668
C'mon, push

1956
02:31:47,876 --> 02:31:50,418
Do it for Champ

1957
02:31:50,668 --> 02:31:53,085
C'mon, Mona

1958
02:31:54,835 --> 02:31:56,876
He's coming out!

1959
02:31:58,251 --> 02:32:00,001
You can do it

1960
02:32:00,835 --> 02:32:03,168
Yes Mona, push

1961
02:32:11,043 --> 02:32:12,209
Farhan, turn it off

1962
02:32:12,210 --> 02:32:13,210
Ok, off

1963
02:32:33,501 --> 02:32:35,251
Two clips,
cut the umbilical cord

1964
02:32:35,585 --> 02:32:37,751
Farhan, two clips on the cord

1965
02:32:38,501 --> 02:32:40,501
Get scissors - Be careful

1966
02:32:41,751 --> 02:32:44,001
Cut at the center, get a towel

1967
02:32:46,835 --> 02:32:49,126
Pia, he's not crying

1968
02:32:53,418 --> 02:32:56,293
Hey Champ!

1969
02:32:57,668 --> 02:33:00,085
Rancho, rub his back

1970
02:33:02,376 --> 02:33:04,376
Hey Champ - Come on, Champ

1971
02:33:06,251 --> 02:33:08,335
No, nothing

1972
02:33:08,835 --> 02:33:09,835
Blow air into his mouth

1973
02:33:17,043 --> 02:33:18,043
C'mon, Champ

1974
02:33:23,418 --> 02:33:24,418
No response

1975
02:33:48,626 --> 02:33:52,210
Hush Mona, say - All is well

1976
02:33:57,501 --> 02:33:58,501
He kicked

1977
02:33:59,751 --> 02:34:00,751
What?

1978
02:34:01,501 --> 02:34:02,751
He kicked

1979
02:34:06,251 --> 02:34:07,543
Say - All is well

1980
02:34:09,210 --> 02:34:16,085
All is well

1981
02:34:57,543 --> 02:35:00,876
<i>If Virus had said, 'My grandson
will be an engineer'</i>

1982
02:35:01,043 --> 02:35:02,876
<i>I would've broken his jaw</i>

1983
02:35:03,585 --> 02:35:06,376
<i>But when he finally spoke,
he stunned us</i>

1984
02:35:06,710 --> 02:35:09,835
What a kick!
Wanna be a footballer?

1985
02:35:10,918 --> 02:35:13,918
Be what you want to be

1986
02:35:30,418 --> 02:35:34,293
Wait - I've not finished with you!

1987
02:35:36,710 --> 02:35:39,251
First day of college,
you'd asked me a question …

1988
02:35:39,626 --> 02:35:42,001
Why didn't astronauts
use a pencil in space?

1989
02:35:42,793 --> 02:35:45,043
If a pencil tip breaks

1990
02:35:45,251 --> 02:35:51,126
it'd float in zero gravity.
Get into eyes, nose, instruments …

1991
02:35:51,293 --> 02:35:53,210
You were wrong

1992
02:35:54,835 --> 02:35:56,668
You cannot be right all the time

1993
02:35:58,793 --> 02:35:59,793
You understand?

1994
02:36:02,251 --> 02:36:03,251
Yes, sir

1995
02:36:04,376 --> 02:36:06,460
This was an important invention

1996
02:36:07,793 --> 02:36:08,793
You understand?

1997
02:36:10,210 --> 02:36:11,210
Yes, sir

1998
02:36:13,626 --> 02:36:21,626
My Director said, 'When you find
an extraordinary student …'

1999
02:36:40,876 --> 02:36:45,293
Go, study!
Pass your exams and leave

2000
02:36:54,210 --> 02:36:56,293
<i>And now, Student of the Year …</i>

2001
02:36:56,543 --> 02:36:59,001
<i>Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad</i>

2002
02:37:16,668 --> 02:37:17,960
Sir, one photo

2003
02:37:35,460 --> 02:37:38,876
<i>I wanted to capture all these
memories and take them home</i>

2004
02:37:40,960 --> 02:37:46,335
<i>That day, we hugged,
we rejoiced, we cried …</i>

2005
02:37:46,626 --> 02:37:48,426
<i>We vowed that we'd meet
at least once a year …</i>

2006
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:52,376
<i>Who knew then, we were seeing
Rancho for the last time</i>

2007
02:38:26,335 --> 02:38:27,335
Untie him

2008
02:38:30,626 --> 02:38:32,501
I'll sue you all in an
American court

2009
02:38:47,001 --> 02:38:48,001
Raju

2010
02:39:06,876 --> 02:39:08,835
Only Rancho can create
a school like this

2011
02:39:09,418 --> 02:39:10,460
But where is he?

2012
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:16,168
Don't pee here

2013
02:39:17,293 --> 02:39:18,876
Go away creatures

2014
02:39:19,293 --> 02:39:22,335
Don't pee here - I'll smack you

2015
02:39:40,126 --> 02:39:42,293
Bingo! He cannot be far

2016
02:39:53,793 --> 02:39:56,043
Excuse me, where is Ranchhoddas?

2017
02:39:56,210 --> 02:39:58,292
- He's not Ranchhoddas!
- Rancho …

2018
02:39:58,293 --> 02:40:00,460
Chhote … Dammit,
what's his name?

2019
02:40:00,626 --> 02:40:03,293
Calm down. Come with me

2020
02:40:05,793 --> 02:40:06,793
- Where's he?
- Rancho

2021
02:40:14,085 --> 02:40:17,210
Farhan, he's read all your books

2022
02:40:23,543 --> 02:40:29,543
Raju, he reads your blog everyday.
Proudly shares it with the kids

2023
02:40:33,085 --> 02:40:36,543
Remember your helmet, Pia?
It was stolen …

2024
02:40:38,501 --> 02:40:41,668
Who are you? How do you know us?

2025
02:40:41,960 --> 02:40:44,001
- Didn't you recognize me?
- No

2026
02:40:44,960 --> 02:40:48,918
How would you?
Millimeter is now Centimeter

2027
02:40:54,001 --> 02:40:58,460
Not Centimeter, you're Kilometer

2028
02:40:59,335 --> 02:41:00,417
How did you get here?

2029
02:41:00,418 --> 02:41:03,626
I got a letter with
a train ticket inside

2030
02:41:03,918 --> 02:41:07,626
It said - 'Miss being in school?
Catch this train'… I did

2031
02:41:09,251 --> 02:41:10,335
That rascal Rancho!

2032
02:41:14,543 --> 02:41:15,543
Where is that idiot?

2033
02:41:26,710 --> 02:41:28,585
Dorje, you fly it

2034
02:41:43,585 --> 02:41:49,043
<i>Every night you ride into my dreams
on a scooter, dressed as a bride</i>

2035
02:41:50,001 --> 02:41:52,251
<i>Instead of a veil,
you lift your helmet</i>

2036
02:41:52,918 --> 02:41:55,626
<i>and come close to kiss me</i>

2037
02:41:59,251 --> 02:42:00,651
Couldn't you tell me
before leaving?

2038
02:42:02,835 --> 02:42:03,835
No

2039
02:42:05,460 --> 02:42:06,460
Sorry

2040
02:42:06,751 --> 02:42:07,751
Did you marry?

2041
02:42:08,168 --> 02:42:12,376
What? No

2042
02:42:13,376 --> 02:42:15,960
- You?
- Almost … Idiot

2043
02:42:23,585 --> 02:42:24,585
So?

2044
02:42:25,918 --> 02:42:26,918
So what?

2045
02:42:27,418 --> 02:42:28,710
Do you love someone?

2046
02:42:33,168 --> 02:42:34,168
Yes

2047
02:42:40,043 --> 02:42:41,043
Who?

2048
02:42:42,210 --> 02:42:43,210
You

2049
02:43:08,793 --> 02:43:11,960
See, the noses don't collide,
stupid

2050
02:43:13,210 --> 02:43:14,210
That's right!

2051
02:43:14,293 --> 02:43:15,376
Rancho

2052
02:43:16,918 --> 02:43:17,918
Hi … Farhan!

2053
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:20,043
Screw your 'Hi'

2054
02:43:20,501 --> 02:43:25,210
Hey, listen to me …
No, you listen to me

2055
02:43:25,418 --> 02:43:27,668
I can explain everything

2056
02:43:28,793 --> 02:43:29,710
Hi … Raju!

2057
02:43:29,711 --> 02:43:31,585
How we hunted for you!

2058
02:43:34,501 --> 02:43:38,585
Didn't have a coin
for one phone call?

2059
02:43:40,668 --> 02:43:42,918
Add a couple from me too

2060
02:43:43,501 --> 02:43:48,668
Rascal, scoundrel Let him go now

2061
02:43:48,835 --> 02:43:49,835
Ok ok, enough

2062
02:43:51,126 --> 02:43:52,876
On your feet, c'mon

2063
02:44:22,918 --> 02:44:24,626
Having fun, idiots?

2064
02:44:24,918 --> 02:44:26,751
Hey … Hi Chatur

2065
02:44:27,085 --> 02:44:32,126
Ranchhoddas Chanchad.
How do you do, Mr. Teacher?

2066
02:44:32,585 --> 02:44:39,335
Wow, you're a teacher in a village -
A for Apple, B for Ball …

2067
02:44:41,293 --> 02:44:46,001
Our trains left together.
But yours traveled in reverse …

2068
02:44:46,585 --> 02:44:49,460
from engineer to primary teacher

2069
02:44:51,668 --> 02:44:54,543
What's your salary, Chanchad?
5000/-?

2070
02:44:54,960 --> 02:44:56,710
For me that's $100

2071
02:44:57,168 --> 02:45:00,543
My son's pocket money is
more than your salary

2072
02:45:00,751 --> 02:45:03,501
Cut the crap
Crap is what he gave us

2073
02:45:03,710 --> 02:45:08,751
Wanted to change the education
system, change the world

2074
02:45:09,001 --> 02:45:11,543
Finally what does he change?
Kids' diapers

2075
02:45:12,043 --> 02:45:13,443
You gonna break his jaw
or should I?

2076
02:45:13,626 --> 02:45:14,626
Just relax

2077
02:45:14,627 --> 02:45:21,376
Remember I'd said
one day you'd cry and I'd laugh?

2078
02:45:23,085 --> 02:45:29,835
Sign here.
Accept - You lost, I won!

2079
02:45:30,126 --> 02:45:33,126
'Declaration of Defeat'!
Unbelievable, man

2080
02:45:33,335 --> 02:45:35,376
Chatur - Crazy guy

2081
02:45:37,210 --> 02:45:41,501
Hey, this is Virus's pen!
You pinched it?

2082
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:43,335
Forget it, man

2083
02:45:44,043 --> 02:45:47,710
This is for winners, not losers

2084
02:45:48,835 --> 02:45:55,793
If your school ever needs help,
call my assistant for a donation

2085
02:45:57,960 --> 02:46:00,751
A for Apple, B for Ball …

2086
02:46:02,293 --> 02:46:05,043
He hasn't changed at all!
Ignore him

2087
02:46:05,210 --> 02:46:06,668
He's full of crap

2088
02:46:07,043 --> 02:46:11,418
Good news is your name
isn't Ranchhoddas Chanchad

2089
02:46:11,835 --> 02:46:15,835
Imagine, after marriage,
I'm Pia Chanchad - Yuck!

2090
02:46:16,626 --> 02:46:18,085
By the way,
what is your real name?

2091
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:19,960
Phunsukh Wangdu

2092
02:46:20,668 --> 02:46:21,668
Wangdu?

2093
02:46:21,751 --> 02:46:22,751
Pia Wangdu!

2094
02:46:23,293 --> 02:46:25,001
You mean you're a scientist?

2095
02:46:25,251 --> 02:46:26,543
You have 400 patents?

2096
02:46:26,710 --> 02:46:28,625
I won't change my name
after marriage

2097
02:46:28,626 --> 02:46:30,334
You mean you're Chatur's Wangdu?

2098
02:46:30,335 --> 02:46:32,584
It's you the Japanese are wooing?

2099
02:46:32,585 --> 02:46:33,585
I don't like Wangdu

2100
02:46:34,085 --> 02:46:36,251
Are you a scientist
or a teacher?

2101
02:46:36,710 --> 02:46:38,709
Scientist,
but I also teach children

2102
02:46:38,710 --> 02:46:40,875
So you are THE Phunsukh Wangdu?

2103
02:46:40,876 --> 02:46:42,001
Yes, yes!

2104
02:46:43,293 --> 02:46:46,168
Hey Silencer
Hey Chatur, come back

2105
02:46:47,460 --> 02:46:48,543
Take that

2106
02:46:50,126 --> 02:46:52,376
Wait, I'll stop him

2107
02:47:00,293 --> 02:47:03,876
Mr. Wangdu,
I can't believe it's you

2108
02:47:04,418 --> 02:47:05,750
I'm sorry, Mr. Chatur

2109
02:47:05,751 --> 02:47:08,043
I can't sign the deal
with your company

2110
02:47:08,585 --> 02:47:10,585
What sir? Why sir?

2111
02:47:10,835 --> 02:47:13,626
How do I sign, man?
You took my pen

2112
02:47:15,543 --> 02:47:17,501
What pen, sir?
I didn't get you …

2113
02:47:17,876 --> 02:47:22,043
The one in your hand -
Virus's pen

2114
02:47:25,585 --> 02:47:27,043
Mr. Wangdu …?

2115
02:47:27,251 --> 02:47:28,418
Yes, Chatur?

2116
02:47:29,251 --> 02:47:31,210
A for Apple, B for Ball is …

2117
02:47:34,376 --> 02:47:36,001
… S for Screwed

2118
02:47:43,168 --> 02:47:47,251
You got me, Rancho -
I mean, Mr. Wangdu

2119
02:47:47,668 --> 02:47:49,251
Totally floored me. Good one

2120
02:47:49,960 --> 02:47:54,210
I hope our personal problems
won't affect this deal

2121
02:47:54,418 --> 02:47:57,585
Hey Chatur - take that

2122
02:47:58,251 --> 02:48:00,210
I was just joking, man

2123
02:48:00,626 --> 02:48:04,460
Deep down,
I knew you'd do great things

2124
02:48:05,501 --> 02:48:07,375
You're fibbing

2125
02:48:07,376 --> 02:48:09,417
No, really, I swear

2126
02:48:09,418 --> 02:48:11,376
Rancho - 100, Chatur - 0

2127
02:48:11,793 --> 02:48:14,085
You win, I lose.
You don't believe me?

2128
02:48:15,543 --> 02:48:16,959
Beware of farts

2129
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:21,334
Your Majesty, thou art great.
Accept this humble offering

2130
02:48:21,335 --> 02:48:23,668
Free advice, Mr. Wangdu -
Run for your life!

2131
02:48:27,418 --> 02:48:31,460
Rancho, I'll lose my job, man.
I have small kids …

2132
